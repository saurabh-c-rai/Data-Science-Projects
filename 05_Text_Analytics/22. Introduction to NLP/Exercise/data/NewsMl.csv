"The Internet may be overflowing with new technology but crime in cyberspace is still of the old-fashioned variety. The National Consumers League said Wednesday that the most popular scam on the Internet was the pyramid scheme, in which early investors in a bogus fund are paid off with deposits of later investors. The league, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, tracks web scams through a site it set up on the world wide web in February called Internet Fraud Watch at http://www.fraud.org. The site, which collects reports directly from consumers, has been widely praised by law enforcement agencies. ""Consumers who suspect a scam on the Internet have critical information,"" said Jodie Bernstein, director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection. Internet Fraud Watch ""has been a major help to the FTC in identifying particular scams in their infancy."" In May, for example, the commission used Internet reports to shut down a site run by Fortuna Alliance that had taken in over $6 million, promising investors they could earn $5,000 a month from an initial deposit of $250. Instead, Fortuna kept most of the money, the commission charged. Fraud reports from the league's site, which has been visited over 370,000 times, are forwarded to local, state and federal authorities. The second-most-popular Internet scam, the league said, was the sale of bogus Internet services, such as custom designed web sites or Internet access accounts. In third place were crooks who sell computer equipment, such as memory chips or sound boards, over the net and then deliver significantly lower quality goods or nothing at all, the league said. Other top scams involve business opportunities. Con artists may offer shares in a business or franchise using unreasonable predictions or misrepresentations. One popular scheme promised to let consumers get rich while working at home. The League also announced Tuesday that NationsBank had donated $100,000 to become a sponsor of the Fraud Watch site.

"The U.S. Postal Service announced Wednesday a plan to boost online commerce by enhancing the security and reliability of electronic mail traveling on the Internet. Under the plan, businesses and consumers can verify that e-mail has not been tampered with and use services now available for ordinary mail like sending a certified letter. ""The leap from trading messages to buying and selling goods has been blocked by the fear of security threats,"" Robert Reisner, vice president of stategic planning, said.   ""To expand from local area networks and bilateral secure communications to wide use of electronic commerce will require a new generation of security services,"" Reisner said. Cylink Corp is developing a system for the Post Office to use to verify the identity of e-mail senders. The system will enable people to register a digital ""signature"" with the Post Office that can be compared against electronic mail they send. If any tampering is discovered, the Postal Service would investigate, just like it investigates tampering with regular mail, Reisner said.   The Post Office is also using the Internet to enhance non-electronic mail delivery. In conjunction with Sun Microsystems, the Postal Service has also developed a new online system for bulk mailers that relies on Sun's Java computer language, Reisner said. Instead of manually calculating postage rates for bulk mailings, possibly using outdated forms, a bulk mailer will be able to add up the charges using a software application written with Java and posted on the Internet.   Eventually, the Post Office plans to offer hybrid services involving both kinds of mail, Reisner said. Electronic mail could be converted to paper and delivered within one business day, for example. Or someone who moves could register a change of address with the Post Office over the Internet. Critics of the Post Office's Internet plans have said the service is usurping functions that could be better performed by the private sector. But Reisner rejected those arguments, maintaining that the Post Office has often facilitated the spread of new technologies, such as railroads and aircraft.   ""Remember the pilots who returned from World War I and then risked their lives in an even more dangerous duty,"" Resiner said refering to early airmail delivery efforts. ""To keep these daring pilots alive, the Postal Service had to create parts of what we know as the weather service today. Navigation aids had to be developed. We are watching many of these same dynamics today. Earlier experience tells us that this is a public and private job."" --202-898-8312 ",AaronPressman

"An influential Internet organisation has backed away from a proposal to dramatically expand the number of addresses available on the global computer network. The Internet Society, which helps develop and coordinate Internet standards, announced this week that instead of moving ahead with the proposal it would form a nine-member committee to study the issue. Unveiled in August, the proposal was an attempt to quell the growing number of disputes over desirable address names. ""There just seems to be no consensus at all,"" said Don Heath, president of the society. A variety of objections and questions have been raised about the August proposal, from technical networking issues to concerns about protection for trademarks and intellectual property. ""We thought we should try to pull it all together and have a good cross-section of people to discuss it and see if we can't reach a consensus,"" he said. The new committee ought to finish its work by early next year and new names could be doled out four to six months later, Heath said. The committee could decide not to go forward with any address expansion, but Heath said that was an unlikely outcome. ""The facts of life are that people want descriptive names and vanity plates,"" Heath said. Disputes over Internet names are occuring with increasing frequency as more companies seek to publicise and market their products over the Net. For example, Viacom Inc.'s MTV cable music channel fought with one of its employees who had registered ""mtv.com,"" eventually regaining control of the name in an out-of-court settlement. Every site on the World Wide Web must have a unique address name. Most addresses end with one of a few three letter designations, known as top-level domains, including ""com"" for private sites, ""gov for government sites and ""edu"" for sites run by schools. In August, Internet Assigned Numbers Authority said it would oversee the creation of up to 150 new top level domains, easing the squeeze, especially for names in the private sector category. The authority, operating under charter from the society and the Federal Network Council, is the central coordinator of Internet addresses and other standards. The society's board of trustees voted in June to accept a preliminary version of the numbers authority proposal, with the proviso that the business aspects of proposal be fleshed out. But with the ensuing controversy, the society decided a committee was needed to reexamine the proposal, Heath said. The committee will meet confer mostly by telephone and online, though an open forum is planned for mid-December in California. The committee will include two members appointed by the society, two by the numbers authority and two by the Internet Architecure Board. The International Telecommunication Union, the World Intellectual Property Organisation and the International Trademark Association will each appoint one member. ",AaronPressman

"When a company in California sells a book to a consumer in Canada from a Web site hosted on a computer in England, what laws govern the transaction? As sales of all kinds of goods over the Internet continue to grow, questions are multiplying about basic regulations covering consumer protection, taxation and other issues. ""Most commercial law has built in a hidden assumption of geographical boundaries within which certain kinds of actions will occur,"" said Jerry Kaplan, who runs an Internet site called OnSale that auctions electronic merchandise. ""Now the legal system is facing a medium which is inherently boundary-less."" For example, some states tax transactions that originate within their borders while others hope to collect so-called use taxes when their residents buy from out-of-state merchants. ""Sin"" laws on obscenity, gambling and sales of alcohol also differ from state to state and apply to some Web merchants. With the potential for so much confusion, some online mavens argue the federal government should step in and set clear policies. ""The role of the federal government is to set national standards or national policy,"" said Gary Arlen, president of Arlen Communications and a leading analyst of online companies. ""A lot of what we're talking about online transcends state borders and even national borders."" A top priority is protecting consumers' private information. ""More regulation is really needed on the privacy issues compared to other areas,"" said Jonathan Rosenoer, an attorney and author of the online ""Cyberlaw"" column. Existing laws protect some kinds of records, like medical data, but not other information, Rosenoer said. Both real and imagined privacy violations are feeding public sentiment in favour of reform. Lexis-Nexis was deluged with protests last month after word spread that the database company was selling personal information such as social security numbers and maiden names over the Internet. The company responded that its P-TRAK product no longer provided social security numbers and never contained maiden names. But it withdrew the names of thousands of individuals that asked to be deleted. Following the controversey, the Federal Trade Commission asked Congress to amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a law governing personal financial information held by credit agencies. The commission suggested the law be extended to cover nonfinancial information like social security numbers. In many cases, however, the federal government is still deciding what steps to take. The Treasury Department, which has a hand in tax policy, banking regulation and international trade, has several groups studying online commerce issues but has not reached any conclusions yet. Top Treasury officials and banking regulators have expressed a desire not to intrude on the nascent market for electronic money. Some banks would like federal rules barring non-banks from issuing electronic money. ""Heavyhanded, pre-emptive attempts to regulate these products before any social risks have been demonstrated would handicap innovation,"" Federal Reserve Gov. Edward Kelley said earlier this month. There is little confusion about criminal scheming online, however. The Federal Trade Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission are all prosecuting online crooks and collecting complaints at their Web sites. ""It's not an area where we need new laws or new authority,"" John Stark, special counsel of Internet projects at the SEC said. ""It's the same swindles, just in a different medium."" ",AaronPressman
"U.S. laws governing the trillion dollar futures markets could be rocked by the Supreme Court's interpretation of the word ""in"" in a case to be argued Wednesday. But a legislative solution is in the offing. At issue is a 1974 amendment to the Commodity Exchange Act, the primary law regulating trading of futures contracts on everything from wheat and corn to interest rates and electricity.   Futures exchanges say a broad reading of the amendment would put them out of business, while major banks argue a narrow reading would force them to move vast operations out of the United States. Whatever the outcome, Congressional action is expected next year. ""It's certainly significant, but I suspect that at the end of the day, legislation will overtake this,"" said Howard Schneider, former Commodity Futures Trading Commission general counsel.   When Congress expanded the commodity act in 1974 to cover futures on non-agricultural commodities and created the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to police the markets, some big banks objected. They argued the law should not apply to trading of foreign currency, government securities and similiar items already flourishing among banks and securities firms. The Treasury Department agreed and in a letter to Congress suggested an amendment to the law that became known as the Treasury Amendment.   The amendment says ""transactions in"" foreign currency, security warrants, repurchase options, government securities and a few other items are exempt from the Commodity Exchange Act unless they involve sale for future delivery conducted ""on a board of trade."" The banks continued to trade foreign currencies unimpeded but the CFTC began to encounter a new problem. Unscrupulous ""bucket shops"" that peddled off-exchange commodity contracts to rip off unsuspecting investors were expanding into foreign currency schemes.   The CFTC shut down the forex shops but lawyers for the shops argued forex investment contracts should be considered transactions ""in"" foreign currency and exempt from CFTC rules. Lower federal courts took up the issue but reached conflicting conclusions. Some said ""transactions in foreign currency"" exempted dealings only with actual currencies, not derivatives on the currencies like futures and options. Others decided that ""in"" exempted all trading involving currencies. The Supreme Court will likely resolve that conflict in Wednesday's case concerning William Dunn, the manager of a $180 million hedge fund investing in foreign currencies.   In November, 1993, Dunn told his investors he had lost $95 million. The CFTC soon charged Dunn with fraud under the Commodity Exchange Act. A lower court agreed. Asking the Supreme Court to uphold that decision, CFTC lawyers argue that Congress would have used the word ""involving"" rather than ""in"" if it had wanted to exempt forex derivatives. But Dunn's lawyers and four banks that dealt with his fund maintain that the CFTC has no jurisdiction to prosecute under the commodity act.   Affirming the earlier decision would undermine the $40 billion a day global currency market by subjecting it to unworkable regulation, the banks said. And Dunn, if guilty of any misconduct, could be prosecuted under wire fraud or securities laws, the banks said. At the other extreme, the Chicago futures exchanges appear terrified the court will strike down the lower court ruling.   Chicago Board of Trade, in an amicus brief written in part by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel in the Whitewater investigation, warned that a broad reading of the exemption would create havoc, allowing unregulated dealings in all kinds of futures contracts now traded on exchanges. ""The idea that someone could clone the Board of Trade's principal products, trade them off-exchange and not be subject to any regulation is pretty darn troublesome,"" Mark Young, another exchange attorney, said. A ruling is not expected for months, but the banks and exchanges will have to continue their struggle in the legislative venue almost immediately. Congress could resolve the dispute through legislation, which would render the decision moot. One bill was introduced in the last Congress to amend the Treasury Amendment and Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN) has said he will likely offer a new bill early next year. -- 202-898-8312 ",AaronPressman
"Supreme Court justices Wednesday sharply questioned rules governing so-called derivative investments and foreign currency trading in a case that could have wide repercussions for both markets. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has traditionally prosecuted crooks who ripped off the public with fraudulent investments. But sophisticated investors such as big banks have been allowed to trade similiar financial instruments with little direct regulation, market participants said. That distinction has been blurred in recent years, as defendants accused of fraud by the CFTC have sought to rely on an exemption from regulation, relied on by the bigger players, in a 1974 amendment to the Commodity Exchange Act. The amendment was added at the request of the Treasury Department to ensure that sophisticated investors trading in foreign currency and a few other markets would not be subject to uneccessary regulation by the CFTC. Lower courts have made conflicting rulings about the 1974 amendment and the Supreme Court decided last year to hear the case of William Dunn, a foreign currency investment advisor charged with fraud by the CFTC after losing $95 million of his clients' money. Jeffrey Minear, assistant to the Solicitor General -- the federal government's representative before the Supreme Court -- defended the CFTC's prosecution of Dunn before the court Wednesday. Minear argued that the 1974 exemption for ""transactions in foreign currency"" did not cover Dunn's trading in foreign currency options, one type of derivative. A derivative is an investment whose value is derived from a stock, bond, currency, commodity or other instrument. But justices questioned Minear's distinction, which relied heavily on the particular meaning of the word ""in."" Congress was ""not using consistent language"" in the commodity laws passed in 1974 and since then, Justice Antonin Scalia said. ""They use in, they use on, they use involving."" Minear drew a sharp rebuke from Chief Justice William Rehnquist when he later argued that Congress expressed greater concern about fraudulent use of options than other types of investments under a 1922 commodity trading law. ""Perhaps it was true in 1922 but that doesn't prove it's true now,"" the chief justice interjected. Gary Stumpp, Dunn's lawyer, argued that other federal agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission might have jurisdiction over fraudulent foreign exchange trading but not the CFTC. Several Wall Street trade groups and big banks filed friend-of-the-court briefs in support of Dunn's position. They warned that if the court upheld the CFTC's position, the burden of additional regulation might drive the gigantic $40 billion a day foreign exchange market in the United States might overseas. On the other side, Chicago futures exchanges said they could be put out of business by unregulated competitors if the court throws out the CFTC's case against Dunn. Brooksley Born, chairwoman of the CFTC, attended the argument but declined to comment afterwards. A decision is not expected for at least a few months. Several members of Congress have said they may introduce legislation early next year to change the 1974 amendment, possibly rendering the verdict in the Dunn case moot. ",AaronPressman
"The Internet continued to grow in leaps and bounds this year while online services found it much harder to add new customers, a survey said Friday. An estimated 35 million adults in the United States had used the Internet, according to the poll by Louis Harris and Associates conducted in late September, up from 27 million at the beginning of the year. ""Although the number of people who use computers has fluctuated around just over half of the adult population, the number of adult Americans using computers for cyber-activities is growing,"" said Humphrey Taylor, chairman of the polling organisation. While online services like America Online Inc. and Compuserve Corp. could lay claim to almost 41 million subscribers, that was the same level Harris found back in January. Online services, which provide private online content in addition to Internet access, have faced greater competition this year from companies like AT&amp;T Corp., which provide cheaper Internet-only access. Businesses, which are looking to the Internet as a potential source of new revenue, are intensely interested in figures on its usage. Differing surveys have come up with widely varying numbers. The Harris poll found that, although more people are getting wired, they are on average spending less time in cyberspace. Home users said they were online 2.8 hours a week, down from three hours a week in an April survey. Business and other users said they were online for 1.8 hours, down from two hours in April. The poll also reinforced findings of earlier studies showing that more educated people were more likely to use computers and access the Internet. People with college and graduate degrees were twice as likely to use computers and four times more likely to access the Internet as people who only graduated from high school, the poll found.

"Hewlett-Packard Co. unveiled a new plan Monday to boost sales of computer encoding technology, considered a key component of global communications and the development of commerce over the Internet. The plan is intended to foster the growth of online commerce worldwide while still abiding by strict U.S. export laws limiting the sale of encryption products abroad. Sales of goods and services over the Internet are booming but still lag well behind traditional sales by telephone or in person. Some businesses say that consumers are nervous about sending credit card numbers or other sensitive information over the Internet, where it could be intercepted by criminals. Encryption scrambles information, such as a credit card number, while in transit so that it can be read only by the intended recipient using a password or a software ""key."" ""The bad news is that, unless you encrypt your information, it's very easy for electronic eavesdroppers to have a look at what you're transmitting,"" said Brad Silverberg, senior vice president at Microsoft Corp., a Hewlett-Packard partner in the new encryption framework. The Hewlett-Packard plan is ""the first government-approved encryption framework removing a significant barrier to making the Internet secure for business transactions and electronic communications,"" company Chief Executive Officer Lewis Platt told a news conference in Washington. Intel Corp., another partner in the effort, said it plans to incorporate encryption into its market-leading computer hardware products. Federal export laws prohibit the sale of strong encryption technology outside the United States. Last week, President Clinton signed an executive order liberalising but not eliminating the export rules. Companies will be allowed to sell products with strong, built-in encryption features but only if the products also contain a feature that allows the government to break the codes when acting under a court order or similiar authority. The administration said law enforcement authorities need the ability to decode messages by having access to the software keys, a system called key recovery or key escrow, in order to keep tabs on criminals and terrorists. Under the Hewlett-Packard framework, powerful encryption features in a new computer or software could be automatically disabled if the product is sold abroad and does not permit government decoding. That may not be enough to satisfy those opposed to the administration's policy, including some businesses and civil libertarians. ""It's not a solution for us,"" said Shari Steele, staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties group that focuses on cyberspace issues. She said people should have the right to use encryption free of government-mandated escrow. ""The government is just strong-arming some companies by saying if you want to use strong encryption at all, you have to have key escrow,"" Steele said. ",AaronPressman

"The growing business of doing business on the Internet poses a major challenge to tax collectors, but no special taxes should be imposed in cyberspace, the government said in report released Thursday. ""Treasury believes that these new technologies should not be used to justify new taxes,"" the Treasury Department draft report said. ""Accordingly, Treasury is not considering any type of value added tax, 'bit tax,' or other new excise tax on electronic commerce."" Instead, the current system should evolve to tax income from all sources in a consistent manner, the department said. ""Our overall tax policy goal in this area should emulate policy in other areas -- maintain neutrality, fairness and simplicity -- a policy which serves to encourage all desirable economic activity new and old,"" the report said. Businesses are already struggling with tax proposals from state and local governments, according to Kent Johnson, head of sales and transaction tax practice at KPMG Peat Marwick. ""State governments don't feel the same way as the federal government, but this report may be a good starting point for discussing all the issues,"" Johnson said. This year, about $1 billion of goods and services will be sold online, growing to over $7 billion by the year 2000, according to market researchers at Jupiter Communications. But the myriad tax laws and regulations affecting businesses may not keep pace with the fast-paced, often chaotic growth of the worldwide computer network. Buyers and sellers on the Internet can be in different states or even different countries, complicating the task of collecting tax at the ""source"" of a transaction. The department also said it was worried that tax evaders could use the anonymity provided by the Internet as a mask to avoid reporting income or to transfer money to offshore bank accounts. But the report made no recommendations about how the government should deal with tax evasion issues. ""Treasury intends to study, and requests comments on these issues,"" the report said. The report is available on the Treasury's web site, http://www.ustreas.gov. The report on taxation is likely to be followed by reports on other aspects of online commerce that the department is studying, including consumer protection, electronic money, bank regulation and law enforcement, officials said.

"A leading software industry group is backing away from its early support of the Clinton Administration's new policy to ease export rules on computer encoding technology. In a letter to vice president Al Gore, the Business Software Alliance, which includes Microsoft Corp and International Business Machine Corp's Lotus Development, warned that rules implementing the new encryption export policy appeared to be flawed.   ""It appears that significant backtracking has occurred since the October 1 announcement,"" the alliance wrote. ""Therefore, we seriously doubt that the regulations will work, meet consumer demands or be accepted by the private sector unless the administration radically changes its approach immediately,"" the alliance added. A spokeswoman for Gore said Greg Simon, the vice president's chief domestic policy adviser, and other administration officials working on the rules have met with the software group to discuss the criticism.   ""There is still an internal decision making process going on,"" spokeswoman Heidi Kukis said. Final rules are expected by January 1, she said. The administration is attempting to craft a compromise on export sales of products containing encryption, computer programs that use mathematical formulas to scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software ""key."" Under current laws dating from the Cold War, products for export can only include very weak coding features.   But with the growth of the Internet and online commerce, encryption is spreading as a means to ensure secure communication between businesses and to safeguard consumers' credit card numbers. U.S. software companies argue they are losing substantial overseas sales to foreign companies not bound by the export laws. U.S. law enforcement and intelligence officials counter that the spread of sophisticated encryption will make their jobs far more difficult.   Under the compromise policy announced in October and enacted in an executive order last month, companies would be able to export strong encryption but only if the products also contained a feature known as ""key recovery"" that would permit the government to decode scrambled data. The software alliance said in October that the new policy was a ""step in the right direction."" In its letter this week, however, the alliance said it was not happy with the rules being drafted to implement the policy. ""Everything we have seen and heard to date reveals that the government is headed in the absolute wrong direction,"" it said.   Part of the debate revolves around the definition of key recovery. The alliance said key recovery should consist of products which allow the government to decode stored communications, such as an E-mail message saved on a computer hard drive. But products should not be required to allow government decoding of real-time communications. ""There is little if any commercial demand for key recovery function in real-time communications,"" the alliance wrote. ""Our members have seen nothing to suggest that any product developed to date can work on a mass market scale or that there is significant commercial demand for such products."" A number of companies, including Microsoft and IBM, have announced products designed to meet the new export policy. But not all of them easily allow real-time key recovery. Although Microsoft is trying to create products to meet the export policy, ""we still feel government should liberalize the policy more,"" John Browne, head of the company's Internet commerce group, said. -- 202 898-8312 ",AaronPressman
"A U.S. District Court judge Wednesday barred new federal regulations that allow credit unions to expand their membership beyond workers at one company, saying this would exceed the legal limits of the institutions. The rules have raised the ire of banks who, fearing the loss of customers, have been battling in court since 1990 to keep credit unions to their traditional role of serving members of just ""one"" community or occupation. The new rules, which the National Credit Union Administration adopted last month after an unfavorable court ruling, redefined ""a single common bond"" that is the basis of credit union membership. On Wednesday, Judge Thomas Jackson issued an injunction blocking the new rules, saying they were merely an attempt to circumvent earlier court rulings. Earlier court rulings limited members of a credit union to a single company or organization. The court actions struck down a 1982 NCUA decision allowing credit unions to draw members from multiple companies. Under the latest NCUA rules, credit unions could include members of a single trade, industry or profession even if the members worked for different companies. Jackson chastised the NCUA and said the federal credit union regulator was acting more like a trade association. Jackson also said the agency must rescind 31 applications that it had already approved for credit union charters under the new rules. The judge said he might refer the matter to the attorney general for further investigation of what he termed collusive behavior among the agency and credit unions. ""Why did you go about it in such a surreptitious, collusive, underhanded way?"" Jackson asked lawyers for the agency at a hearing Wednesday. Eric Goulian, a lawyer for the Justice Department, denied the agency had acted improperly and said the new rules were a response to emergency conditions. The fireworks were the latest development in a six-year-old case before Jackson pitting the American Bankers Association against the agency and the credit union industry. In 1990, the ABA and five North Carolina banks filed suit againt AT&amp;T Family Federal Credit Union, which had grown to encompass members from more than 150 different occupational groups. In July, a U.S. Court of Appeals handed the banks a major victory in the case, ruling that the NCUA had exceeded its statutory authority in allowing single credit unions each to serve members of more than one employer. Jackson issued injunctions in October implementing the ruling. The injunctions limited more than 3,500 non-profit credit unions nationwide to members who share a ""single common bond."" The credit union industry has said the injunctions will result in millions of people being expelled from credit unions, with some unable to afford similiar but more expensive services from banks. Two weeks after Jackson issued the injunctions, the credit union agency adopted new rules, now set aside, to dramatically expand the definition of a single common bond. The new rules also allowed credit unions to have as many as 1 million members, up from 25,000 under the old rules. After the hearing, Brenda Furlow, general counsel for the Credit Union National Association, said the industry was considering an appeal. ""Clearly, we're disappointed with the ruling,"" she said. ""Basically, banks are trying to aggressively protect their competitive interests and the American consumer loses."" Paul Schosberg, president of the trade association America's Community Bankers, praised Jackson's ruling. ""The NCUA has clearly stretched the law's common bond requirement beyond all recognition,"" he said. ",AaronPressman
"The Internet could provide a huge boost to the U.S. economy if the federal government pursues ""free market"" policies in cyberspace, a group of President Clinton's top advisers says in a draft report obtained by Reuters. The group, an interagency task force headed by senior presidential adviser Ira Magaziner, recommended that the administration work globally to protect the Internet from new taxes, censorship and other onerous forms of regulation. After seven months of deliberations, the task force is preparing to issue for public comment a report of principles and policies the Unites States should pursue, Magaziner said in an interview. ""One of the things we're trying to do with this paper is as much say what government should not do as say what they should do,"" Magaziner said. ""A lot of what industry is concerned about is that governments are already beginning to take actions around the world that would inhibit commerce."" The growth of Internet commerce could help boost U.S. exports of everything from movies and news to software and consulting services. Exports of such products totalled $40 billion in 1995, the draft report noted. The idea is to hitch U.S. exports to the speeding Internet commerce train. Sales of goods and services online are projected to grow to $7 billion in the year 2000, from about $1 billion this year, according to market researchers at Jupiter Communications. ""Companies have told us there would be a tremendous potential to increase world trade across the Internet if we could provide the right kind of environment,"" Magaziner said. The draft report, called ""A Framework for Global Electronic Commerce,"" covers nine issues, from taxation and customs to privacy and security. On taxation, the draft report echoes a report issued by the Treasury Department last month by stating no new taxes should be imposed. Acting through the World Trade Organisation, the United States should push for the Internet to be designated a duty-free zone, the draft said. Some consumers worry that their privacy will be violated when they shop online. The report said governments should push vendors to disclose what will be done with information about consumers rather than dictate to merchants what they can or cannot do with the data. On some issues, such as encryption -- encoding information in a scrambled format to provide a measure of security or privacy -- existing administration policies may be seen as conflicting with the free market approach of the draft report. Magaziner said policies will evolve over time, ""but the paper will reflect where we are now."" Magaziner headed Clinton's failed effort to reform the U.S. health care system, an initiative critics said favoured government over the private sector. While disagreeing with his critics' characterisation of the health care plan, Magaziner said the Internet ""is a wholly different animal. ""I'm a problem solver, not an ideologue,"" he said.

"The Clinton administration will modestly revise controversial export rules for computer encoding technology after a private meeting Wednesday with computer and telecommunications companies, a top Commerce Department official said. ""This is a work in progress,"" Under Secretary of Commerce William Reinsch said in a telephone interview after the hour and a half long meeting. ""There will be some changes that will be more than technical.""   The administration circulated a draft this week of new rules that would overhaul Cold War era export limits on products containing encryption, computer programs that scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software ""key."" With the growth of the Internet and online commerce, demand for encryption-capable products is growing worldwide. Coded messages can keep a business' e-mail confidential or protect a consumer's credit card number sent on the Internet. Reinsch and others who attended Wednesday's meeting said the tone was civil.   ""We had a long meeting but it was actually quite a constructive one and actually also a polite one,"" Reinsch said. Industry officials argued at the meeting that the draft rules were unclear or unworkable on a number of points. ""In some cases we could tell them what we meant which made them feel better and now we'll go off and try to fix it,"" Reinsch acknowledged. ""In other cases we're going to have to think a little more about what they said and in some cases I'm not sure there is a way to fix it.""   ""We are not optimistic that these (rules) will be turned around and we feel going to Congress is our only option,"" Smiroldo said. The alliance includes a dozen large software firms including Microsoft Corp and International Business Machine Corp's Lotus Development. Several bills that would dramatically ease encryption export limits were introduced in the last Congress and are expected to be revived next year. Ambassador David Aaron, appointed by President Clinton as special envoy for cryptography last month, also attended the meeting, Reinsch said. The draft rules implement an executive order signed by President Bill Clinton last month. Under the order, limits on export of products containing strong encryption would be eased if the products allowed the government to decode encrypted messages by recovering the keys. The draft rules detail for the first time the government's definition of acceptable key recovery features and other aspects of the revised export approval process. For example, until 1999, companies will be allowed to export some products that do not include key recovery if the companies promise to include key recovery in future products. -- 202-898-8312 ",AaronPressman
"A break-in at the U.S. Justice Department's World Wide Web site last week highlighted the Internet's continued vulnerability to hackers. Unidentified hackers gained access to the department's web page on August 16 and replaced it with a hate-filled diatribe labelled the ""Department of Injustice"" that included a swastika and a picture of Adolf Hitler. Justice officials quickly pulled the plug on the vandalised page, but the security flaws that allowed hackers to gain entry likely exist in thousands of other corporate and government web sites, security experts said. ""The vast majority of sites are vulnerable,"" said Richard Power, senior analyst at the Computer Security Institute. ""The Justice Department shouldn't be singled out."" Justice Department officials said the compromised web site was not connected to any computers containing sensitive files. The web site (http://www.usdoj.gov) included copies of press releases, speeches and other publicly available information. The security breach ""is just like graffiti on the outside of the building,"" spokesman Bert Brandenburg said. Other organisations have been targeted in the past. Last year, the Nation of Islam's Million Man March web site was vandalised. And hackers make 250,000 attempts annually to break into U.S. military computers, according to a General Accounting Office report. Windows Magazine recently found security flaws at web sites of a dozen major corporations. ""The web is spectacularly insecure,"" editor Mike Elgan said. Relying on security holes that had been documented by software manufacturers months earlier, the magazine's specialists were able to gain various degrees of unauthorised access at the different sites. Elgan said hackers who are exploiting some of the same flaws are motivated by anger over the growth and commercialization of the Internet. ""A common theme is that hackers are fed up with non-hackers on the Internet,"" he said. The battle is not completely hopeless. ""You can secure a web site,"" Richard Power said. ""There's all kinds of measures you can take. Most corporations and institutions don't take them simply because nothing bad has happened to them yet."" Some sites are using multiple layers of security, well beyond simple password protection, to keep hackers out. One site mentioned by Windows Magazine was Fidelity Investments. Fidelity's site advertises its mutual funds and disseminates information about personal finance but does not contain confidential customer information. Fidelity officials immediately closed the loophole identified by the magazine, a spokeswoman said. But multiple security measures previously in place would have prevented a security breach despite the hole, the spokeswoman added. ",AaronPressman
"If the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System does as expected early Friday and votes to expand banks' non-banking activities, it will only heighten the drive in Congress to overhaul U.S. banking regulations completely, analysts and industry officials said. The Fed is expected to vote to allow banks' section 20 subsidiaries to derive 25 percent of their revenue from non-banking activities such as securities underwriting, up from the current 10 percent ceiling.   The section 20 proposal was released for comment in July, but since then another bank regulator has stolen some of the Fed's thunder. Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig said his office will begin approving bank affiliates moving into an assortment of non-banking businesses. Both the Fed's proposal and the Comptroller's actions will raise the pressure on Congress to scrap the Glass-Steagall Act, according to Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institute.   In the past, banks led the charge to change the law because they wanted to get into other businesses, like selling insurance or underwriting stock deals. Insurance companies and securities firms generally opposed the banks creating legislative gridlock. ""Now the tables have been turned,"" Litan said. ""But it's not a two-way street. Other industries will want to level the playing field.""   Both moves also reflect current market realities. The financial services industry, from banks to insurance companies to mutual funds, is converging. Mutual funds already offer checking account-like money market funds and some of the leading stock and bond underwriters are commercial banks. In the words of one top regulator, the Fed's move from 10 to 25 percent, ""is not material."" The Fed has required banks to take certain steps to prevent problems in the subsidiaries from affecting the bank itself, and its government-insured deposits. Competitors in other fields fret that the banks insured deposits are a form of government subsidy giving the banks an unfair advantage when they venture into other fields. Comptroller Ludwig disagreed. Speaking to reporters after delivering a speech here Thursday, Ludwig said that walling off the subsidiary ""basically eliminates any subsidization."" He opposes efforts by some in Congress to keep banks out of certain fields, such as real estate or merchant banking, entirely. ""It's a mistake to set product limits, particularly in this day and age when we have such a dynamic marketplace,"" he said. ((--Aaron Pressman, 202-898-8312)) ",AaronPressman
"The Federal Reserve took another step Friday toward eliminating the barriers between banking and other financial service industries, voting to allow banks to further invade the turf of Wall Street securities firms. The Fed Board of Governors voted unanimously to increase the percentage of revenue bank subsidiaries may earn from underwriting and dealing in securities to 25 percent from 10 percent. Bank subsidiaries have been bumping against the 10 percent limit and earlier this year the Fed cited Swiss Bank Corp. for exceeding the cap. Banks were elated by the new rule. ""This is a tremendous boost for banks that already underwrite securities and an incentive for banks considering this business,"" American Bankers Association managing director Larry LaRocca said. Securities firms, however, were not pleased. ""It's as if Santa Clause delivered all the gifts to only one house in the neighbourhood,"" said Steve Judge, senior vice president for the Securities Industry Association. Bruce Thompson, director of government relations at the nation's largest brokerage firm, Merrill Lynch and Co., said he hoped the greater latitude given to banks would not reduce the banks' previous support for Congressional action. ""We hope this does not reduce their incentive,"" he said. ""The time really is coming for having everyone put aside their own particular interests and support comprehensive reform."" Officials at leading banks said they still wanted Congress to take more dramatic action. ""We need complete financial reform,"" Rachel Robbins, general counsel of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co, said. ""This addresses one piece of it and doesn't address it completely but until Congress can act this is a welcome action."" For decades, securities underwriting was the exclusive purview of firms like Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers. But since 1987, when the Fed first allowed bank subsidiaries to earn 5 percent of their revenues from underwriting, big banks like J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. and Bankers Trust have made dramatic inroads. While the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act generally prohibits banks from engaging in non-bank activity, under section 20 of the Act banks may affiliate with firms not ""engaged principally"" in such areas. Currently, 41 bank ""Section 20"" subsidiaries have permission to engage in underwriting. The Fed's action will add to pressure on Congress, which was already planning to review the entire scope of financial sector regulation next year. Securities firms, insurance companies and others who opposed lifting restriction on banks in the past will likely favour reform this time around, according to Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institute. Raising the revenue cap, and an announcement last month by the Comptroller of the Currency allowing banks another avenue for entering unrelated fields, only go halfway, Litan said. ""It's not a two-way street. Other industries will want to level the playing field,"" he said. At Friday's meeting, Fed governors called for Congress to follow their lead and and revise the laws. ""We hope that the next move will be up to the Congress in this whole area,"" Fed Vice Chairwoman Alice Rivlin said. ",AaronPressman
"The Federal Reserve Friday rebuffed a request by the Justice Department to allow U.S. banks to collect data about borrowers as part of an effort to discourage racial discrimination in lending. The unanimous decision put the central bank's board in the unusual position of being at the center of a national debate about how best to discourage discrimination. On the one side: those who see the collection of data on race, gender, age, religion and other charecteristics as a way to ferret out discrimination. On the other: opponents who view such collection as discriminatory on its face. Backed by banking regulators at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Justice Department urged the Fed to change a regulation that prohibits banks from collecting such data except in the case of mortgage lending. The department argued that the lack of data was hindering its ability to evaluate charges of racial discrimination in lending to small businesses. In an unanimous decision, the central bank's board voted against changing Fed Regulation B, saying it might lack the authority to act without new legislation from Congress. ""The issue ... is not some technical matter of law or economics,"" Fed Governor Lawrence Lindsey said. ""Rather, it is at the center of a heartfelt and ongoing debate in America about the direction of public policy with respect to individual characteristics,"" he added. The regulation, which was established in 1977, was designed to discourage discrimination by race, gender and age by prohibiting banks from collecting such data from borrowers. Fed Governor Edward Kelley described the proposed change in the regulation as ""social policy of the most profound sort"" and said it ""provides no answer to the social conundrum that's before us."" That is not the way the Justice Department sees it. In a letter to Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan Friday, Associate Attorney General John Schmidt said changes in the regulation would help combat discrimination. ""Allowing credit providers to collect certain basic data seems to us to be a useful step toward getting a better handle on the extent of this problem,"" he said. Existing studies, though limited, ""do appear to provide some support for the widespread view ... that minority-owned businesses face unusually difficult barriers in obtaining this type of credit,"" Schmidt added. Creditors and their trade associations had opposed the regulation change, which was first released for comment by the Fed in April, 1995. ",AaronPressman
"An international task force working to resolve the simmering controversy over desirable addresses on the Internet released a draft plan Friday for a substantial expansion of the total number of destinations. The International Ad Hoc Committee on domain names, formed by the Internet Society in October, recommended that seven new so-called top-level domains be added to the Internet. Top-level domains are the three-letter designations most Internet sites end with, such as ""com"" in http://www.gm.com and other commercial sites, ""gov"" in government sites and ""edu"" for sites run by schools. The committee recommended that an unlimited number of firms be authorised to register the new addresses, although the panel said it hoped to initially approve 20 to 30 new registration services. Addresses for most sites are currently handed out by Network Solutions Inc. of Herndon, Va., which charges $100 for each registration. At first, Network Solutions would continue to have a monopoly on the domain names it already controls but the committee said its ""ultimate goal"" is to have all names handled by all qualifed firms. ""The IAHC members were faced with a formidable challenge,"" said Donald Heath, president of the Internet Society and chairman of the committee. ""We accomplished our goal, in no small part, because we were able to bring people together from around the world, via the Internet."" The full text of the recommendations was posted on the Internet at http://www.iahc.org, Heath said. The proposal will be open for public comment until Jan. 17 and a final report is expected by Feb. 3. New names and competing registration services should help quell disputes over popular or trademarked names. Disputes are arising more frequently, usually when the holder of a trademark discovers that someone else is using their trademark as the name of an Internet site. For example, Viacom Inc.'s MTV music channel fought with one of its employees, who had registered ""mtv.com,"" eventually regaining control of the name in an out-of-court settlement. In another case, a journalist tweaked McDonald's Corp. by registering ""mcdonalds.com"" before the fast-food giant did and before the Web had attained its current prominence. The address now belongs to McDonald's. Once new top-level domain names are available, 10 people or organisations could register similar names. The new top-level domains will contain three to five letters but have not yet been selected. The committee included members from the Internet Society, which helps coordinate and develop Net standards; the Internet Assigned Number Authority, which oversees certain of the standards, and the Internet Architecture Board, which helps draft and promulgate new technical standards. The committee also included representatives from the International Telecommunications Union, the World Intellectual Property Organisation and the International Trademark Association. ",AaronPressman

"U.S. banks will be able to significantly increase their securities underwriting activities under a rule adopted Friday by the Federal Reserve, but that will only add pressure on Congress to overhaul the entire regulatory system, market participants said. The Fed voted unanimously to allow so-called section 20 subsidiaries of banks to derive as much as 25 percent of their revenues from underwriting and dealing in securities such as stocks, corporate bonds and commercial paper. The new rule takes effect in 60 days, the Fed said.   At the meeting, Fed governors called for Congressional action to reform the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act and other laws separating banks from non-bank financial services industries. ""We hope that the next move will be up to the Congress in this whole area,"" Fed vice chair Alice Rivlin said. ""Legislation is needed but I think this is a constructive step and it is appropriate for us to interpret the existing legislation,"" Governor Susan Phillips said. While the Glass-Steagall Act prohibits banks from engaging in non-bank activity, under section 20 of the Act banks may affiliate with firms not ""engaged principally"" in such areas.   The Fed said it currently authorizes 41 bank subsidiaries to deal and underwrite securities, ranging from stocks and bonds to commercial paper and mortgage-backed securities.

"The Federal Communications Commission proposed Tuesday to trim the $23 billion a year that long-distance telephone companies pay to local service providers in access fees. But the commission ducked the contentious issue of whether such charges should be imposed on Internet service providers, asking for comment on the issue without offering any proposals. In a notice of proposed rule-making, the commission said it could cut the access fees in either of two ways: it could impose a schedule of long-distance access charge reductions or wait to allow market forces to drive fees lower. The access charges, which make up a substantial portion of local phone company revenues, were adopted after the break-up of AT&amp;T Corp. in 1984 that led to the creation of the regional ""Baby Bell"" local service companies. New telecommunications rules signed into law in February are supposted to foster more competition for local and long-distance service and drive prices lower. Long-distance companies, which say the access fees are excessive, favour deep, government-mandated cuts. ""We recommend the FCC to move as quickly as possible to squeeze the $10 billion in excess access fees out of the local exchange industry and put it back in the pockets of consumers,"" AT&amp;T said in a statement. Local phone companies concede that the fees exceed their actual costs for carrying long-distance calls but would prefer a gradual reduction based on competition and market forces. The FCC ""must not allow the long-distance companies to continue to benefit at the expense of consumers,"" said Roy Neel, president of the U.S. Telephone Association, which represents local service providers. While local providers have already cut access fees by $9 billion, ""the long-distance oligopoly has raised rates in lockstep more than six times,"" he said. Under the FCC's market-based approach, new entrants in the local market would compete with the Baby Bells to connect long-distance calls. The FCC would gradually relax and ultimately remove price caps and access fee schedules while relying on competition to drive the fees down. The alternate approach would specify the nature and timing of changes in existing rate levels. Ultimately, the FCC said it could adopt parts of both approaches. Local phone companies also connect Internet users to Internet service providers over local phone lines, but they receive no access charges for those calls. Recently, several Baby Bells complained that Internet users were getting a free ride, tying up local lines with often lengthy calls. The FCC did not take a position on whether Internet service providers should be required to pay access fees. In a less formal ""notice of inquiry,"" the agency asked for comment on possible reform ""relating to interstate information services and the Internet."" Comments are due by Jan. 27 on the long-distance access fee proposals and by Feb. 21 on the Internet issue. ",AaronPressman
"The Federal Communications Commission has tentatively decided not impose fees on Internet service providers for use of local telephone lines, an official said Thursday. On Tuesday, the commission issued a notice of proposed rulemaking setting out two possible plans for reducing the $23 billion a year that long-distance telephone companies pay to local service providers in access fees. ""The commission raised the specific question of whether ISPs (Internet service providers) should pay access charges as we currently understand them,"" Kevin Werbach, counsel for new technology at the commission said. The FCC ""tentatively concluded that the answer is no."" Local phone companies had pressed to have the access fee applied to Internet service companies. The phone companies argued that consumers using the Internet were getting a free ride and tying up local lines with lengthy calls. Internet companies countered that such fees would smother the growth of the booming online industry. ""We think they did exactly the right thing,"" said Jill Lesser, deputy director of law and public policy at America Online, the largest online service in the world. ""It means the FCC is thinking in the right way about this. They're thinking for the growth of the Internet."" The commission did issue a ""notice of inquiry"" asking for comments on the issues involved, Werbach said. The arguments of both sides raise ""legitimate issues, so the commission initiated the notice of inquiry to develop a record on that,"" he said. A notice of inquiry seeks comment but does not give the commission authority to then adopt a rule. The commission would have to first issue a notice of proposed rulemaking before applying access fees to Internet service providers, Werbach said. The Internet notice is ""more foward looking"" than the proposed rules for long distance access fees, Werbach said. ""Once we have an idea what replaces the access charge system then we can take a look at that,"" he said. ",AaronPressman
"The Commerce Department will issue final rules on Dec. 30 to implement its new policy on export of computer encoding products, but the proposal is unlikely to mollify the software industry and privacy advocates who objected to a draft version. Some changes were made in the final rules, available Friday at a government printing office, from the earlier draft. But the bulk of the proposal remains the same, including portions strongly criticized by the software industry that applied to real-time communications. Commerce undersecretary William Reinsch had said two weeks ago that the draft rules would be modestly revised, but warned that some objections could not be addressed. Under the previous rules dating from the Cold war, the administration severely limited the export of products containing encryption, programs that use mathematical formulas to scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software ""key."" In the past, products could be exported using ""keys"" as long as 40 digital bits, a string of forty ones and zeros. But as the speed of computers has grown, 40-bit keys have become easy to crack and longer keys have come into general use. At the same time, with the growth of the Internet and online commerce, demand for encryption-capable products is growing worldwide. Coded messages can keep a business' e-mail confidential or protect a consumer's credit card number sent on the Internet. The Commerce Department rules were intended as a compromise, allowing U.S. companies to compete in the encryption market while protecting the interests of law enforcement officials. The policy relies on so-called key recovery features which allow government officials to decode encrypted messages when acting under proper legal authority. Under the policy to be issued Monday, products containing key recovery features will be eligible for export after a one-time review. Software firms had hoped the key recovery exception would only apply to stored data, like a document on a hard drive. But the final rules, like the draft rules, also require key recovery for real-time data transamission such as coded phone calls. Non-key recovery software with keys of up to 56 bits will be exportable under six-month, renewable licenses until the end of 1998, but only if the manufacturer commits to producing software with key recovery by then. Some companies had complained that the government was asking for too much information about their future plans, but the final rules still require submission of detailed plans and committments. All other encryption products, such as state-of-the art 128-bit software without key recovery features, would continue to be treated as munitions. Such products include ordinary e-mail programs and even the recently introduced set-top box for surfing the Internet with a television. The rules deleted a draft provision allowing keys to be stored with a recovery agent located outside of the United States. The final rules also made clear that an applicant's public support of the administration's policy would not be a factor in export license decisions. Rather, helping build the necessary infrastructure would be a factor, the final rules said. A criteria listed as ""public support for a key management infrastructure,"" was changed to ""or other support for the key management infrastructure."" ",AaronPressman
"House Banking Committee chairman Jim Leach introduced a bill on Tuesday aimed at remaking the regulatory landscape for banking and other financial services in the United States. A similiar bill Leach introduced in the previous Congress foundered last June amid opposition from the insurance industry and House Democrats.   Analysts have said this year's bill might have a better chance of passage, but that was before Leach decided to oppose Newt Gingrich's reelection as Speaker of the House, a move that could turn the leadership against his bill. ""This bill provides expanded powers for the banking, securities and insurance industries,"" Leach said in a statement. ""The ultimate beneficiaries of this legislation, however, are consumers.""   ""Not only will there be more products available to banking customers who are looking to maximize their savings, but efficiencies should lower industry costs and therefore costs to consumers,"" Leach said. If passed, the bill would break down the legal barriers enacted after the Great Depression between banks, securities firms and insurance companies. Bank regulators have already begun eroding the barriers for banks, putting pressure on Congress to level the playing field, analysts said.   The Federal Reserve voted Dec 20 to allow bank subsidiaries to garner a greater share of revenue from underwriting activity. And a month earlier, the Comptroller of the Currency's office said it would allow banks to enter an array of non-bank markets. Leach said his bill would repeal Section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act and amend Section 32 to allow for the merger of commercial and investment banks.   Bank subsidiaries would be allowed to engage directly in securities dealing and other activities considered ""part of and incidental to"" banking. Affiliates of bank holding companies, would be allowed to engage in insurance activities as principal, agent or broker. The bill would also abolish the federal charter for thrifts while grandfathering existing thrift holding companies. National thrifts would have the option of transferring to a national or state bank charter or a state savings and loan charter. The Iowa Republican's bill would continue to prohibit commercial companies outside the finance sector from owning banks. The bill was also sponsored by three other Republican members of the Banking Committee: Rep Marge Roukema of New Jersey, Mike Castle of Delaware and Rick Lazio of New York. The full committee will hold hearings on the bill and any related legislation in early March, Leach said.

"A computer scientist barred from exporting a floppy disk containing computer encryption programming asked a federal court Friday to strike down the export limits as a violation of his right to free speech. Philip Karn challenged the rules after the State Department in 1994 denied his request to export the programming on disk but allowed him to export the identical material contained in a book. U.S. law treats many kinds of encryption, computer coding and decoding programs, under the same category as munitions.   The Clinton administration recently issued new rules relaxing the export limits, but most existing encryption programs remain classified as munitions and are subject to strict export limits. The limits infringed on Karn's constitutional rights to free speech and due process, his attorney, Kenneth Bass, told a three judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on Friday. The First Amendment of the Constitution ought to apply equally to computer code written in a book or saved in text form on a floppy disk, Bass argued.   ""It just cannot be that the Constitution doesn't recognize progress,"" Bass said. Karn did not attempt to export ""object"" computer code, a working program that could be run on a computer to encrypt and decrypt data. Karn's disk contained ""source"" code, or directions that could be used to write such software. In another case, Federal district court Judge Marilyn Patel held last month that source code should be considered a protected form of speech. But the ruling, in the Northern District of California, is not binding on the D.C. Appeals court. ",AaronPressman
"Fast running out of options, federal credit unions are hoping the Supreme Court will decide Friday to wade into the midst of their six-year legal battle with the banking industry. The Supreme Court's nine justices are expected to decide whether or not to hear the credit union case, lawyers involved in the case said. The banks, who filed suit to challenge a 1982 policy adopted by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) relaxing previous membership limits, have urged the court not to take the case. Lower courts have agreed with banks that membership should be sharply limited at thousands of credit unions, cooperative non-profits that offer bank-like services. If the court decides not to hear the case, membership limits could force many credit unions to be dissolved or broken up into smaller, less-efficient institutions, according to Tim Pryor, federal regulatory counsel to the National Association of Federal Credit Unions. ""It would be kind of like a court-ordered savings and loan crisis,"" Pryor said. ""This case is extremely important to the safety and soundness of the industry."" If at least four justices favour taking the case, the credit unions would have a final chance to erase the limits. Oral arguments could be scheduled for later this term, with a decision likely by the summer. ""This is about settled law,"" said Michael Crotty, counsel for the American Bankers Association. If credit unions want to change the membership limits, they should go to Congress and ask for legislation, he said. ""The policy of who gets to be a member of a credit union is not a judicial issue but a legislative one,"" added Crotty. Until 1982, credit unions were limited to having members with a single common bond, people who worked for the same employer or lived in the same neighbourhood. But that year, the NCUA began allowing credit unions to include members from multiple, distinct groups. That angered banks, which contended that some of the larger tax-exempt credit unions posed unfair competition. In 1990, the banks sued a North Carolina credit union that had grown to encompass more than a hundred groups. The case wound its way through the system, reaching the federal appeals court for the District of Columbia last year. The court ruled the NCUA had exceeded its authority and that members of each credit union must share a single common bond. A lower court then ordered credit unions to stop accepting members from more than one group, although the order was partially suspended until the Supreme Court makes a decision or declines to hear the case. The case, First National Bank and Trust Co. v NCUA et al, is on a list of cases the Supreme Court justices are scheduled to discuss Friday. It is possible that the justices might not get to the case Friday, and then it would likely be discussed at a conference next month, lawyers said. ",AaronPressman
"The growing mass of Internet users have paid their fair share to local telephone companies and pose little threat to the phone system, according to a study released on Wednesday by a coalition of Internet and computer companies. The coalition presented the report to counter studies by local phone companies released last year seeking to justify new access fees on Internet usage. The phone company studies found that Internet usage threatened to overwhelm the system.   ""The Internet is not crashing the telephone network,"" Information Technology Association of America President Harris Miller said at a news conference here. ""We are bringing the real facts to bear on a 'problem' that the phone companies have anecdotally created to protect their own interests,"" said Miller, whose group is a member of the Internet Access Coalition. On December 24, the Federal Communications Commission said it had tentatively decided not to impose access fees on Internet providers similiar to those paid by long distance companies to local phone companies.   But the commission also asked for comments about the effect of the Internet on the phone system. ""Our findings clearly show that claims of phone network 'congestion' resulting from Internet traffic and predictions of a 'meltdown' are greatly exaggerated,"" said Lee Selwyn, one of the study's authors. Further, ordinary consumers using the Internet already pay the phone companies more than enough to cover the cost of increased use, said Selwyn, who is an expert on telecommunications regulation.   The study found, for example, that in 1995 consumers paid more than $1.4 billion for installation and use of six million second phone lines devoted to accessing the Internet or other online services. The study said another eight million second lines were not primarily used for Internet access. Local phone companies, some of which had not yet seen the new study, disputed Selwyn's conclusions.""To suggest that there is no real problem here is mind-boggling,"" Bell Atlantic spokesman Harry Mitchell said. As Internet companies add huge numbers of phone lines to meet growing demand, ""it does impact the capacity of the public telephone network.""   America Online, for example, said recently it would double the number of modems it has to connect with subscribers from 200,000 to 400,000 by June. But phone company studies considered only a few pieces of the phone system, focusing on switches between Internet service providers and the rest of the network, Selwyn said. While those few switches might be congested, capacity could be added inexpensively, he said. The study also cited speeches by some phone company executives who have bragged about the additional revenues generated by increased Internet usage.   ""Sales of secondary lines at Bell Atlantic increased more than 50 percent, fueled by surging demand for Internet and telecommuting applications,"" company CEO Raymond Smith told Wall Street analysts last March. The revenue generated substantial profit because ""we were able to provision new lines and services from idle capacity in an existing plant."" Company spokesman Mitchell said charges from second lines ""were not designed to subsidize Internet service providers."" However, all sides agree that a technological solution could eliminate most congestion problems by separating calls carrying voice and data. SBC Communications, parent of Southwestern Bell, announced last week it would introduce such splitting technology at a cost of less than $100 million.

"Prospects for comprehensive reform of U.S. banking and financial services laws remain bright despite a far-reaching proposal being considered by the Clinton Administration that has upset some banks. Most in government and the industry now agree that the 60-year-old Glass-Steagall Act separating banking from other financial activities like insurance and securities dealing should be scrapped. But there is little consensus about removing the barriers between financial firms and other commercial companies, a position the administration is actively considering for its reform proposal expected in the next two months. ""The feeling is still very, very good that everyone wants Glass-Steagall reformed,"" former Congressman and bank lobbyist Larry LaRocco said. With almost two years left for the 105th Congress, legislators should have sufficient time to come to agreement, added LaRocco, managing director of the American Bankers Association's securities section. ""There's tremendous momentum building. Maybe it won't be in 1997 but certainly within the 105th,"" he said. Federal courts and regulators spurred the momentum last year by lifting many restrictions on banks' non-banking activities, LaRocco noted. As previously reported, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin is weighing the recommendations of a task force headed by Under Secretary John Hawke to remove all barriers between financial and non-financial companies. Under the plan, a company like General Electric Co. or Microsoft Corp. could own or be owned by a financial services company like Citicorp or Aetna. ""There has been an enormous amount of movement on the whole issue in the last two months,"" a person familiar with the administration's deliberations said. Among various bills in Congress and the administration, the commerce issue ""is the last issue that's left, which is an indication of how far we've come. For the first time, the omens are good and this is the only hang-up,"" the person said. The remaining ""hang-up"" has raised strong opposition from House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach along with smaller banks and consumer groups. ""There is no public support and no economic need for the conglomeration of financial institutions and other businesses,"" the Iowa Republican said. ""The nation needs to be concerned about creating jobs, not simply consolidating ownership."" If the administration pushes ahead with the Hawke plan, it would create a ""much longer debate and prolong the process,"" one Leach staffer added. ""This is an issue which (Leach) feels has not been fully debated,"" the staffer said. Small bankers agree. ""It's a proposal that would essentially change and concentrate not only the financial structure of the United States but the whole economic and financial structure,"" said Ken Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association of America. Such concentration would be bad for the economy, Guenther added. ""It is based on very debatable assumptions."" One bill in Congress includes a possible compromise approach, lobbyists noted. Representative Marge Roukema's bill would allow banking, insurance and securities firms to merge and would allow such companies to derive up to 25 percent of their revenues from non-financial activities. The New Jersey Republican, chairwoman of the House Banking Committee's Financial Institutions subcommittee, has lined up some big guns behind her bill. The Alliance for Financial Modernisation, a coalition representing most the large trade groups involved in financial services, broadly endorsed the bill. ",AaronPressman
"With the Clinton administration busily reworking its 1995 proposal overhauling the U.S. financial services sector, one faction in the Treasury Department is recommending a more far reaching plan this time around, people familiar with the matter said. Under Secretary of the Treasury John Hawke, who oversees an administration working group on bank reform, is pressing for a plan allowing commercial companies to own financial companies, they said.   The Hawke plan is said to be in front of Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who carries great weight with the President on financial policy issues. Most in the administration and on Capital Hill agree that the 60-year-old laws separating banking from other financial activities like insurance and securities dealing should be scrapped. But there is still widespread disagreement about letting outside companies into financial businesses. ""There's a major war brewing,"" one lobbyist familiar with the plan said. ""People are choosing up sides and getting to the White House.""   A spokesman for the Treasury did not have an immediate comment. Two years ago, the Clinton plan took a middle path on the issue between House Banking chairman Jim Leach's bill and a proposal put forward by Senate Banking Committee chairman Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. Leach remains strongly opposed to allowing non-financial firms into the financial services sector. The Iowa Republican introduced a bill last month that would allow banks, insurance companies and securities firms to affiliate only amongst themselves.   A second House bill, backed by Rep. Marge Roukema, would allow a financial services company to derive up to 25 percent of its revenue from non-financial activities. Sen. D'Amato, by contrast, favors lifting all limits, allowing a company like General Electric or Ford to own and operate a bank. D'Amato is expected to reintroduce his bank reform measure in the next few weeks, a spokesman said. The notion of allowing commercial companies into banking alarms consumer advocates and small banks. Veteran consumer advocate Ralph Nader wrote a letter to Secretary Rubin last week opposing the Hawke recommendations. Common ownership ""would create powerful conglomerates that would dominate the nation's economy,"" Nader warned in the letter obtained by Reuters. ""The distortion of the allocation of bank credit ultimately would have a substantial adverse effect on competition and the overall productivity of the economy,"" Nader wrote. Small bankers also oppose the plan, which could lead to further consolidation and concentration in the banking industry, lobbyists said. ((--202-898-8312)) ",AaronPressman
"Just days after a U.S. graduate student cracked the most powerful computer encryption system allowed out of the country, the Commerce Department announced it would allow three companies to export an even stronger system. Until this year, computer encryption programmes, which scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software ""key,"" were classified as munitions and stronger programmes could not be exported. But under a controversial new Clinton administration policy that took effect Jan. 1, companies may recieve permission to export stronger programmes. ""I'm happy that we've been able to do this within the first month without rancour or difficulty,"" Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration William Reinsch said in a telephone interview. To export stronger programmes immediately, companies must agree to incorporate features within two years allowing the government to decode encrypted messages by recovering the software keys. The adminstration's policy has been widely criticised as not relaxing the export limits enough and some companies feared the requirement for a two-year plan would substantially delay export approvals. The quick approvals should quell some of the criticism and encourage more applicants, Reinsch said. ""As a result of this, you will have more companies taking it seriously and we will expect more plans over the next couple of months,"" he said. Encryption was once the realm of spies and generals. But with the explosion of online commerce on the Internet, encryption has become a vital tool for protecting everything from a business' e-mail message to a consumer's credit card number sent over the Net. The amount of protection afforded by encryption is largely a function of the length of the software key measured in bits, the smallest unit of computer data. Companies said products with just 40-bit long keys, the old limit, were too easy to crack. The approvals came just days after Ian Goldberg, a graduate student at the University of California, cracked a message encoded with a sofware key 40-bits long. The government did not name the companies on Friday given permission to export stronger, 56-bit programmes, but Glenwood, Maryland-based Trusted Information Systems acknowledged that it was one of the three. ""Recent attacks on 40-bit encryption have shown that a global move to at least 56-bit (U.S. government standard) security must come soon,"" Trusted Information Executive Vice President Steven Lipner said.

"An influential economic research group is preparing guidelines on computer encryption for its member countries but will duck some of the most contentious issues involved, according to a draft obtained by Reuters. The Clinton administration, seeking to rally support for its controversial policy on exporting encryption products -- which encode and decode e-mail and other computerized messages -- failed to win an endorsement from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), although the group did discuss the administration's approach. On perhaps the most difficult issue, the draft guidelines do not favour or oppose a requirement in the U.S. policy that data-scrambling encryption programmes provide a way for law enforcement officials to obtain keys to crack the codes when necessary. After indicating that governments should carefully weigh the costs and benefits of imposing so-called key recovery, the draft report said, ""this principle should not be interpreted as implying that governments should, or should not, initiate legislation that would allow lawful access."" On all the controversial areas in the draft, ""the member countries of the OECD have strongly held views but they don't always coincide,"" John Dryden, head of the group's Information, Computer and Communications Policy division, said in a telephone interview from Paris. Some countries see widespread use of encryption as a way to protect the privacy of computer users and businesses, thereby encouraging global commerce, Dryden said. But others see encryption as possibly thwarting law enforcement's efforts to catch criminals and global terrorists, he said. The guidelines suggest encryption users should have access to products that meet their needs. Government controls should be ""no more than are essential to the discharge of government responsibilities."" Instead of reconciling the different views, the draft guidelines lay out competing interests and approaches. ""It's not in itself a cryptography policy and it's not an attempt to draft a model national law that we're encouraging people to adopt,"" Dryden said. Cryptography refers to products and systems used in encryption. The guidelines also suggest encryption standards and usage should be ""determined by the market in an open and competitive environment."" ""There's a strong view that the private sector should have the possibility to use information networks to the best of their potential in order to create growth and jobs,"" Dryden said. U.S. officials who have seen the preliminary draft praised the guidelines. ""They're an important and helpful step forward,"" Undersecretary of Commerce William Reinsch said. ""They're helpful because they put down on paper the proper foundation for getting into this,"" he added. Reinsch said most countries will follow the U.S. lead and require so-called key recovery features for law enforcement. Under the Clinton policy, domestic use of encryption is not regulated but the strongest coding products cannot be exported unless they include key recovery. U.S. companies that have opposed the Clinton policy, contending it stifles their ability to compete with unfettered foreign firms, drew little solace from the draft guidelines. ""This is not helpful,"" said Netscape Communications Corp.'s public policy counsel, Peter Harter. Netscape and other companies preferred stronger language endorsing free-market policies, he said.

"An international Internet group released its plan Wednesday to dramatically increase the number of available addresses in cyberspace while quelling disputes over the use of trademarks in those address names. The International Ad Hoc Committee, which includes members of Internet standards-setting bodies and legal and communications experts, proposed seven new ""top-level domains,"" the last block of letters at the end of every Internet address. If the plan is adopted, Net surfers will see addresses ending in ""web"", ""store"", ""info"", ""firm"", ""arts"", ""rec"" and ""nom"", joining ""com"", ""edu"", ""gov"" and other existing top-level domains. Each new domain reflects a particular type or category of Internet site. For example, ""rec"" would be for sites emphasising recreation and entertainment, while ""nom"" would be for those desiring individual or personal nomenclature. In drafting the plan, the group received more than 4,000 comments from around the world. The consensus-building approach followed an outcry that arose when a few Internet bodies unveiled a similiar plan last August. ""We are very pleased with the acceptance and broad consensus that we have achieved in this process,"" said Donald Heath, president of the Internet Society and chair of the ad hoc committee. ""To attain its fullest potential, the Internet requires true self-governance."" Heath said the plan should be approved by Internet standard setters within a few weeks, allowing new domains to come online about three months later. The plan includes provisions to resolve disputes arising over the use of trademarked names as Internet addresses. Last year, for example, toymaker Hasbro Inc. won a lawsuit to regain control of the Internet address ""candyland.com,"" which was being used for an adult Web site with nude photographs. But more complex disputes are arising where both parties may have a legitimate claim to an Internet address. Under the committee plan, anyone applying for an Internet address will have to agree to resolve disputes through online mediation under the rules of the World Intellectual Property Organisation. Mediation will be provided by panels composed of international experts on intellectual property, trademarks and the Net. Challenges initiated within 60 days of an address registration would be resolved within 30 days. All challenges and proposed decisions would be made public and time allowed for comment before a final decision was rendered. The plan will not completely eliminate court battles, attorneys said. ""It's much better than the policies we've seen in the past, but, just by the nature of how valuable these domains have become, litigation will continue,"" said Paul Terry, Internet law specialist at Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam &amp; Roberts. The plan also calls for establishing up to 28 competing registration firms to dole out the new addresses. The firms will operate under the auspices of a Council of Registrars, to be established as a non-profit association in Switzerland. Currently, one firm, Herndon, Va.-based Network Solutions Inc., hands out addresses in the most popular domains, charging $100 for a two-year registration. Network Solutions, which registers over 80,000 new Internet addresses a month, had no comment on the plan, but a spokesman raised doubts about its viability. ""We're concerned with the stability and integrity of the registration process,"" spokesman Christopher Clough said.

"The various sectors of the U.S. financial services industry will spar over bank reform proposals at a hearing on Tuesday before the House Banking Committee's subcommittee on financial institutions. With most in Congress and industry ready to scrap the Depression-era laws separating banking from other financial services, one of the hottest topics is likely to be whether even broader reform is required. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin is considering a proposal to allow combinations between commercial and financial firms.   While savings institutions and insurance companies can already own or be owned by non-financial companies, banks operate under much tighter restrictions. A Treasury Department task force recommended that the administration's bank reform proposal, expected in about a month, allow mixing of commerce and banking, permitting Ford Motor Co or Microsoft to own Citicorp or BankAmerica. Rubin told a group of bankers at a private meeting last week that the administration has not yet made a decision on the contentious issue, people familiar with the meeting said.   The high-level private-sector group, known as the Federal Reserve's Federal Advisory Council, also met with House Banking Committee chairman Jim Leach last week. Leach, who strongly opposes mixing commerce and banking, told the group of CEOs that their banks could be taken over by larger capitalized companies. ""They'll be at the working end of the food chain,"" Leach reportedly told the bankers according to one person familiar with the meeting. Spokesman for Leach and Rubin declined to comment on the meetings.   At Tuesday's hearing, insurance and savings groups will oppose restrictions on commercial and financial combinations. The mutual fund industry also opposes restrictions. Small banks, represented by the Independent Bankers Association of America, will take the opposite position, in favor of imposing legal barriers. Federal Reserve officials, along with some consumer, agricultural and union groups favor restrictions but will not be heard from on Tuesday. The Fed will testify on Thursday along with other government agencies, while consumer gropups will testify at a Feb 25 hearing.   The AFL-CIO recently sent a letter to the Clinton administration charging that allowing unlimited mergers would drag the U.S. economy back into the 19th century with a ""reinstatement of trusts and monopolies,"" a person who read the letter said. Leading Democrats, including ranking minority members of House and Senate banking panels Rep Henry Gonzalez and Sen Paul Sarbanes, also favor restrictions. Not all Republicans agree with Leach and the Democrats. Rep. Marge Roukema, chairwoman of the financial institutions subcommittee, has introduced a bill that would allow financial companies to do 25 percent of their business in non-financial markets. And in the Senate, Banking Committee chairman Alfonse D'Amato has opposed restrictions and plans to introduce his own bank reform measure soon. Rep Gonzalez is likely to raise questions about the possible risks to federal deposit insurance funds, some lobbyists said. Gonzalez has said conglomerate combinations should have limited access to deposit insurance. ((--202-898-8312)) ",AaronPressman
"The debate over reforming America's financial services sector, a top priority for Congress and the Clinton administration, began in earnest Tuesday. As major industry representatives sat down at a House Banking subcommitee hearing on two pending reform bills, word came that Senate Banking Committee Chairman Alfonse D'Amato, R.-N.Y., had introduced his own version of comprehensive reform. The bills introduced so far, as well as an administration proposal expected late next month, begin with the same premise: the time is right to scrap the Glass-Steagall Act enacted during the Depression to separate banking from other financial activities like securities underwriting and insurance. Most in Congress agree. And, for the first time, most financial service company seem to agree as well. At the hearing of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions, representatives of banking, insurance, securities and mutual funds all agreed Congress should allow a single entity to span all financial services businesses. But, as subcommittee Chairwoman Marge Roukema, a New Jersey Republican, observed, ""The devil is in the details."" Those who had opposed tearing down Glass-Steagall, mainly insurance and securities companies, have seen federal courts and regulators slowly roll back the law -- but only for banks. Last March, the Supreme Court freed banks from many state insurance restrictions. The Federal Reserve also decided to allow banks to derive up to 25 percent of a subsidiary's revenue from securities activity, an increase from the previous limit of 10 percent. In November, the comptroller of the currency said he would start allowing national banks to enter a host of non-banking businesses. Banks got substantial new authority, but others got nothing. ""For too long, important policy issues have been addressed by regulatory agencies or the courts rather than by Congress,"" Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. Vice President Roy Albertalli testified at the hearing. Albertalli spoke on behalf of the American Council of Life Insurance, which had opposed mixing banks and insurance. All the proposals before Congress would level the playing field to some degree and recognise the changes that have shaken modern finance. ""This banking reform legislation will reform the current patchwork of laws and allow the market to operate freely within the financial services industry,"" D'Amato said as he introduced his bill. While a broad consensus has been achieved, several important issues remain to be addressed. Perhaps the most controversial is the extent to which non-financial companies should be allowed to own or be owned by financial companies. Under existing law, mutual funds, insurance companies and savings and loans can combine with so-called commercial firms while banks cannot. Smaller banks and consumer groups staunchly oppose mixing the two, which would be permitted under the D'Amato bill, limited under the Roukema bill and forbidden under a bill introduced by House Banking Chairman Jim Leach, R.-Iowa. Joseph Bracewell of the Indepedent Bankers Association of America laid out the opposition. Citing former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, Bracewell said such mergers could ""distort lending decisions, be anticompetitive and threaten the safety and soundness of the banking system. Banks said they could live with Roukema's compromise approach, but were undecided about the D'Amato plan. Others heartily endorsed the unlimited approach. Mutual funds have been ""knee-deep in affiliations"" and ""they've never proved a problem in 57 years,"" said Matt Fink, president of the Investment Company Institute. Differences also remain regarding regulation of new, diversified financial services companies, although most favoured an approach having various, specialised agencies regulate the relevent portion of each firm's activities.

"Internet access providers and others who met with Net-savvy lawmakers said they fear Congress will wreak havoc on cyberspace but are also heartened by the growing number of legislators who understand the global computer network. Company representatives met Tuesday night at the Capitol with members of the Congressional Internet Caucus, about 85 legislators with a common interest in the Net, to express their hopes and fears about efforts to make laws governing cyberspace. ""I think it's inevitable that there will be bills introduced that attempt to legislate the content of everything on the Internet,"" Tom Evslin, vice president of AT&amp;T Corp.'s WorldNet Internet service, said after the meeting. Evslin said it would be as difficult to keep Congress from making wrong moves as it would be to get the legislature to act to head off problems. Bill Schrader, president of Internet provider PSINet Inc., was more blunt. ""Be very careful or you will destroy this industry,"" he warned. The members of Congress who attended the meeting pledged to try to protect the Internet. ""We have a lot of pretty tough work ahead of us,"" Rep.

"Several U.S. legislators are planning to introduce measures soon to relax export restrictions on encryption technology, an increasingly essential part of global communications and online commerce. Last year, the Clinton administration relaxed some of the Cold War era export limits on the technology, specialized computer programs that scramble data and render it unreadable without a password or software ""key."" But computer companies said the administration did not go far enough, locking them out of the growing global market.   Rep. Bob Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, plans to reintroduce a bill on Wednesday that would go well beyond the Clinton administration's approach, staff people in his office said. Goodlatte's bill would allow computer companies like Netscape Communications Corp or Microsoft Corp to export products with powerful encryption features if foreign competitors were selling similiar technology. In the Senate, Montana Republican Sen Conrad Burns is also planning to reintroduce his encryption bill from last year.   At an informal gathering of the Congressional Internet Caucus Tuesday night, Burns said he expected to put forth the bill, known by the acronym PRO-CODE, in late February. At one time, the Senator had said the 1997 bill would be identical to last year's bill which did not get a vote in the Commerce Committee.  But staffers said the Senator is still tweaking the bill to draw more supporters. ""It's about ready to go,"" Burns said Tuesday night. Goodlatte's bill, under the jurisdiction of the House Judiciary Committee, had already garnered 54 co-sponsors by Tuesday night.   Staff said the bill almost had the backing of a majority of the members of the Judiciary Committee. Others are also considering introducing bills, some seeking a middle approach between the administration and the Burns and Goodlatte bills, which would remove nearly all export restrictions. Sen. Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat and co-chair of the Internet Caucus, may have a bill and Rep Rick White, Pennsylvania Republican and also co-chair, is considering weighing in, staff people said. Some lobbyists involved in the debate said that the administration was considering introducing its own legislation.  But they were unsure about the contents of the legislation, since the administration implemented its new policy by a Presidential executive order in November. Administration officials were not immediately available for comment. ((--202-898-8312)) ",AaronPressman
"Internet access providers and others who met with Net-savvy lawmakers said they fear Congress will wreak havoc on cyberspace but are also heartened by the growing number of legislators who understand the global computer network. Company representatives met Tuesday night at the Capitol with members of the Congressional Internet Caucus, about 85 legislators with a common interest in the Net, to express their hopes and fears about efforts to make laws governing cyberspace. ""I think it's inevitable that there will be bills introduced that attempt to legislate the content of everything on the Internet,"" Tom Evslin, vice president of AT&amp;T Corp.'s WorldNet Internet service, said after the meeting.

"A scuffle breaking out between a top U.S. bank regulator and the state of Rhode Island could foreshadow an increasing number of disputes as more national banks begin selling insurance products, market participants said. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said last month it is considering overriding a new Rhode Island insurance law that imposes different requirements on banks selling insurance than those imposed on on insurance agents.   While national banks have long had the legal right to sell insurance in small towns, state insurance regulators often imposed onerous rules on the banks. But last year, the Supreme Court rejected discriminatory state insurance laws and ruled that states cannot ""significantly interfere"" with national banks conducting permissible activities. Banks said that states are now trying to evade the court's ruling. They charged that an insurance agents trade group is pushing states to adopt laws like the Rhode Island measure.   ""The Rhode Island statute is their first successful effort to pass such restrictive legislation,"" James McIntyre, counsel to Association of Banks-in-Insurance, said in a letter this week to the OCC. ""Many other states are considering similiar legislation or regulations at this time. Guidance from the OCC is urgently needed if we are to avoid wasteful legislation and avoid pointless litigation,"" McIntyre added. Major states such as Texas, Pennsylvania and Illinois are expected to consider similiar legislation, bankers said.   The Independent Insurance Agents of America fired back in their own letter to the Comptroller's office. Preempting the Rhode Island law would be ""wholly inappropriate"" because the law does not significantly interfere with a national bank's ability to sell insurance, the group said. The agents added that an override would be premature. Although the law was enacted in August, the state has not finished writing the implementing regulations. Banks said the law on its face is more burdensome to banks than to others selling insurance.   For example, bank personnel involved in teller activities or making loans would be restricted from selling insurance, forcing banks to have two different sales forces, McIntyre said. The Comptroller's Office is reviewing the comments it received and will issue an opinion, but has not set a deadline for making a decision, a spokesman said. ",AaronPressman
"Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Friday urged Congress to modernise U.S. financial laws but warned that some government oversight must be maintained to avert financial catastrophes. A top priority of regulators, Greenspan said after a speech at a Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta conference here, is to prevent ""systemic risk,"" where a problem in one firm or market spreads through the financial system and ultimately undermines the entire economy. If a bankruptcy or market crash cannot be contained, it could behave like a chain reaction spreading through all markets, he warned. The failure of Drexel Burnham Lambert in the 1980s, for example, raised fears that its collapse would cause a cascade of failures among large Wall Street firms and commercial banks that had lent funds to Drexel. But the firm was liquidated in an orderly fashion and losses did not spread. Using its existing authority to oversee banks and provide loans, the Federal Reserve has been able to contain previous crises, Greenspan said. ""There have been occasions when we have been on the edge of a significant breakout,"" he said, but declined to name the institutions involved. The Fed's actions and other rules governing financial firms ""turned out to be adequate to stem the atomic erosion,"" he said, returning to the nuclear analogy. ""Regulation, by its very nature, becomes increasingly obsolete,"" Greenspan said. ""Regulation imposed in an earlier period would be wholly or partly inappropriate for something that evolves at a later date."" Congress is currently considering several bills to reform laws governing banks, which would affect the Fed, which is one of the nation's primary bank regulators. Legislators have also introduced a measure to modernise rules on derivatives, financial instruments whose value is based on the value of something else such as a commodity, stock or currency price. ""It is important for Congress to periodically review"" such laws, Greenspan said. ""Regulators are required to do that."" For example, in a recent review of Regulation Y, governing non-bank interests of bank holding companies, the Fed found that ""some of that stuff is just unbelievable because the markets have changed so much,"" the Fed chairman said, without elaborating. If Congress alters the Fed's responsibilities, it should not strip the central bank of its ability to contain systemic risk, Greenspan argued. ""Having seen the inner workings of these things, a lot of the things we do actually are quite effective,"" he said. ""I would be very chagrined to see some of these powers disappear ... I say that from someone who believes the less you interfere in the market, the better."" Under one proposal before Congress, the Federal Reserve would remain a primary regulator of financial institutions such as banks. But under other proposals, that authority could be divided among many regulators or entrusted to a new committee of federal regulators. The Fed offered to provide loans following the stock market crash of 1987, for example, preventing a liquidity crisis that could have caused wider problems for the economy. Greenspan also appeared to side with the Treasury Department in its long-running dispute with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over the appropriate scope of U.S. laws governing futures trading. Under a 1974 amendment to the Commodity Exchange Act, trading of foreign currency and certain other instruments is exempt from CFTC oversight. But federal courts have made contradictory rulings about the scope of the amendment, especially as it relates to derivatives, and the Supreme Court is expected to deliver a ruling on the issue soon. Greenspan said Congress did not need to impose new regulations on trading of derivatives over-the-counter by sophisticated institutional investors. ""There appears to be no need,"" he said. Regulation under the commodity act ""seems an inappropriate framework,"" he added. Even trading by less-sophisticated retail investors ""is more appropriately regulated"" by bank regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission, not the CFTC, he said. Greenspan's comments were significant and could affect lawmakers' decisions when they consider related legislation, an Association executive said. ""If you're going to vote on these issues and you've been kind of on the fence with respect to pro-market or expansion of CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) power, etcetera, I have to believe that his comments influence that person who's on the fence,"" said John Frawley, chairman of the Managed Futures Association. ""So if you're looking for a Good Housekeeping seal of approval, he just sort of stamped it on those who are looking for such a thing,"" Frawley told reporters at a briefing. ",AaronPressman
"The Supreme Court said Monday it would decide whether a federal regulator had properly allowed credit unions to expand their membership over the past 15 years, settling a long-running legal dispute between the cooperative non-profits and banks. Credit unions praised the court's action to reconsider an Appellate court decision last July in favour of the banks. But bank representatives said the court was only delaying the inevitable. The 1934 Federal Credit Union Act creating credit unions ""was not meant to delineate and protect bank markets at the expense of the consumer,"" said Marc Schaefer, president of AT&amp;T Family Federal Credit Union, the credit union being sued by banks in the case. ""Consumers everywhere will be the winners when banks compete in the marketplace instead of the courts and on Capitol Hill,"" Schaeffer added. American Bankers Association executive vice president Donald Ogilvie countered that ""the facts and law weigh overwhelmingly in our favour."" ""We are disappointed at the prospect of delay in the enfocement of a law we believe is quite clear,"" he said. The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case in its upcoming term, which begins in October. A decision is likely early next year. The case affects about 3,600 federal credit unions serving 32 million customers, Justice Department lawyer Walter Dellinger said. The appeals court ruling in favour of the banks ""threatens nationwide instability and losses in the credit union industry affecting millions of persons,"" Dellinger said. Until 1982, credit unions were limited to having members with a single common bond, such as people who worked for the same employer or lived in the same neighbourhood. Owned by their members, non-profit credit unions paid no federal taxes and were able to offer bank-like services often at lower prices than banks. But in 1982, concerned about a lack of diversification, the National Credit Union Administration decided to allow credit unions to accept members from multiple distinct groups. As many previously tiny credit unions diversified and grew substantially larger, banks complained of unfair competition. In 1990, they sued AT&amp;T Family Federal, a North Carolina union that had grown to encompass over 150 different groups. After the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia struck down the 1982 policy change last July, a lower court imposed strict membership limits on multi-group credit unions. Those limits have since been put on hold until the Supreme Court makes a decision. But if the banks win, their next move could be to ask the courts to force multi-group credit unions to throw out members from all but one group. Credit unions said they will ask Congress to amend the law if they lose in the Supreme Court. ""Congress never intended the 1934 Federal Credit Union Act to limit credit union growth or to protect banks from competition,"" said Daniel Mica, president of Credit Union National Association, a leading trade group. ""If the court does not see it this way, we think Congress will recognise consumers' need for credit unions."" ((202-898-8312)) ",AaronPressman
"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, one of the nation's primary regulators of derivatives, has no authority over most foreign currency transactions, the Supreme Court said Tuesday. In a unanimous decision, the court ruled that a 1974 law exempting some transactions in foreign currency from CFTC oversight also exempted some foreign exchange derivatives, financial instruments whose value is based on the value of currencies like the dollar or Japanese yen. The CFTC regulates trading of derivatives such as futures and options on everything from wheat and corn to interest rates and electricity. By law, such trading must occur on a recogized exchange, such as the Chicago Board of Trade or the New York Mercantile Exchange. But when Congress created the commission in 1974, it added an amendment permitting off-exchange trading in foreign currency and a few other items without CFTC regulation. The amendment was requested by the Treasury Department, which believed that the developing market in foreign currency among large banks and securities firms would be overregulated by CFTC oversight. The CFTC stayed away from the inter-bank foreign exchange market, which has grown to $40 billion a day in total trading. The commission did, however, prosecute small-scale fraudulent foreign exchange investment peddlers, often called ""bucket shops."" But when the CFTC pursued William Dunn, whose $180 million foreign currency fund lost $95 million in 1993, Dunn argued that the 1974 Treasury amendment should also apply to his trading of foreign exchange options. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court agreed with the bulk of Dunn's argument. ""We think it plain that foreign currency options are 'transactions in foreign currency' within the plain meaning of the statute,"" Justice John Paul Stevens wrote. ""We are not persuaded by any of the arguments advanced by the CFTC in support of a narrower reading."" That pleased banks and Wall Street trade groups, which had sided with Dunn. They argued that subjecting their off-exchange foreign exchange trading to CFTC oversight would be too costly, forcing them to shut down U.S. operations and move overseas. ""We're obviously delighted at the result,"" said Ken Raisler, an attorney for several of the trade groups. ""It supports our view that the amendment should be read broadly,"" Raisler, a former general counsel of the CFTC added. Dunn's lawyer and the banks suggested that any wrongdoing in the foreign exchange area could be dealt with under existing law by other federal agencies, but the Supreme Court did not address the issue. Most off-exchange derivatives trading is not directly regulated, although most participants in such markets are overseen by bank, securities and insurance regulators. The CFTC still has jurisdiction over foreign currency derivatives traded on an exchange, which include futures contracts. But that market is dwarfed by the over-the-counter market among banks and similiar institutions. In a lower court case last year, the CFTC argued unsuccessfully that a fraudulent ""bucket shop"" constituted an exchange. On Tuesday, the commission maintained that the Supreme Court had decided only the narrow issue of whether the Treasury amendment covered options trading. ""While we are disappointed in the outcome of the case, we note that the Supreme Court's opinion was limited to the narrow issue of whether the Treasury amendment treats futures and options the same,"" CFTC general counsel Dan Waldman said. ""The court's decision does not affect the commission's ongoing efforts to police fraud against the public in foreign currency trading."" Congress is already discussing amending the 1974 Treasury amendment. The Supreme Court's decision ""underlines the need for Congress to make decisions about what financial products should or should not be subject to the CFTC's jurisdiction,"" said Andy Fisher, spokesman for the Senate Agriculture Committee. Sens. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., Pat Leahy, D-Vt., and Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, introduced a Senate bill to overhaul futures regulation. ""It makes the case to proceed with that bill as quickly as we can,"" Fisher said. The court invited congressional action. Recognising an ""important public policy dispute"" underlying the case, the court suggested ""these arguments are addressed to the Congress, not the courts."" ",AaronPressman
"Legislators introduced two bills Thursday to overturn the Clinton administration's export limits on computer encryption technology, a key component of online commerce and global communications. Encryption products, which scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software ""key,"" were once the realm of spies and generals. But with the booming growth of the Internet, secret coding is now used for everything from keeping a business's e-mail confidential to protecting a consumer's credit card number if it is transmitted online. Senators said export restrictions on encryption products were hindering the development of the Internet and making it impossible for U.S. companies to compete with foreign firms. The bills ""roll back current restrictions on the export of strong cryptography so that high-tech U.S. firms are free to compete in the global marketplace and meet the demand of customers,"" Sen. Pat Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and co-sponsor of both bills, said at a Capitol Hill news conference. ""Online commerce will never reach its full potential under the policies of this and past administrations,"" said Sen. Conrad Burns, a Montana Republican , also a co-sponsor. The bills would generally allow a U.S. company to export a product with strong encryption features if similiar products were being offered for sale by a foreign supplier. Leahy and Burns introduced similiar measures in the last Congress. Under the current Clinton administration policy, a company may export strong encryption only if the product also includes a feature to allow the U.S. government to crack the code by recovering the software ""key"" when acting under a court order or similiar authority. The administration says it must be able to crack the codes to catch international criminals and terrorists. If the bills became law, mandatory key recovery would be banned but the government would still be permitted to restrict the export of encryption for military use or to countries posing terrorist threats. The legislation would also write into law the current policy permitting unrestricted domestic use of encryption -- but one bill would criminalize the use of codes to obstruct justice. The Clinton administration signalled its displeasure with the new bills. ""We continue to be disappointed with Senator Burns' approach because it does not balance the needs of individual privacy and economic growth with national security and public safety,"" Undersecretary of Commerce William Reinsch said. ""We believe there is a market for key recovery products from businesses who recognise the need for a back door to their own corporate data."" Computer companies and privacy advocates hailed the bills. ""Both bills promote the freedom of this nation's fastest-growing industry to provide customers here and abroad with products they demand,"" said Robert Holleyman, president of the Business Software Alliance. The group includes Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus Development and Apple Computer Inc., among others. ""This is the most important privacy legislation before the Congress today,"" said Jerry Berman, executive director of the Centre for Democracy and Technology. Berman, who strongly opposes mandatory key recovery, said the policy ought to be ""my lock, my key."" ",AaronPressman
"It may be only the second qualifier on the long road leading to the 1998 World Cup but the Czech Republic and Spain are approaching Wednesday night's European group six match as though it were a battle for the final. For the Czechs it will be the first big test since they reached the Euro 96 final, while Spain are expected to give Real Madrid's teenage striker Raul Gonzalez his first cap in the hope that he will give them badly-needed scoring power. Both sides opened their campaigns last month with high-scoring victories over the two weakest teams in the group, Spain winning 6-2 in the Faroe Islands and the Czechs thrashing Malta 6-0. But Yugoslavia have already collected three wins and Slovakia two against the same two hapless victims and neither the Czechs nor Spain can afford to give ground in Prague. ""(The Spanish) are explosive and technically very sound. This game's made all the more important because a loss will make it a difficult trip for either side,"" Czech midfielder Karel Poborsky of English premier league Manchester United said. Victory alone will satisfy Spain's veteran goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta. ""I would not be happy with a draw, we want three points,"" he said. Czech coach Dusan Uhrin has named 16 of the 19-strong squad which caused a surprise by reaching the final of June's European championship in which they lost to Germany. They include in-form midfielder Patrik Berger, who scored six goals in 10 days for English premier league Liverpool last month. ""Spain is obviously a strong team but we showed in London that we can play anybody,"" Berger said. While the Czechs are looking to build on recent success, Spain are rebuilding and plugging holes where necessary. Raul, 19, who scored twice against the Czechs in the quarter-finals of last season's European under-21 competition, is Real Madrid's top scorer even after being moved into a supporting role by new coach Fabio Capello. ""There are some players absent...It's the right moment to pick Raul,"" Spain manager Javier Clemente said. Clemente had been strongly criticised for sticking by veteran forward Julio Salinas instead of choosing Raul. Neither Salinas nor injured striker Kiko Narvaez are on the trip but Kiko's Atletico Madrid team mate Jose Luis Caminero is fit and is expected to be given the role of playmaker in the starting line-up. With Spain likely to face problems in the air, tall defender Roberto Rios and striker Ismael Urzaiz have been called into the squad for the first time. Of the seven players chosen from the multi-billion peseta Barcelona line-up, midfielder Guillermo Amor, defender Abelardo Fernandez and striker Juan Pizzi have not played regularly this season under new coach Bobby Robson, a former England manager.

"Shares on most central and eastern European bourses gained ground this week though there were some indications the upturn may be short-lived. Exchanges in Prague, Warsaw, Budapest, Bratislava and Bucharest all rose, while Zagreb and Sofia traded mixed. Ljubljana was the one gray cloud, posting slight losses. The Central European Share Index (CESI) which reflects the price movements of 50 selected Czech, Polish and Hungarian shares, firmed 66.11 points. PRAGUE Czech share prices were mostly steady on the Prague Stock Exchange throughout the week, with little movement expected soon as the holiday season slowly winds up. The PX50 index edged up 3.6 points from Monday to close at 568.6 on Thursday. Leading trading were SPT Telecom and Komercni Banka, though SPT's movements were largely characterised as ""accounting procedures"" that saw the issue gain as much as 102 crowns one session, only to lose the same amount the following day. ""The final price (of SPT) was not the real market price, but because average prices are not used for the close, it gives an artificial final number,"" said Jan Sykora of Wood and Company. SPT closed on Thursday at 3,340 crowns. Dealers have long-complained that some market participants consistently manipulate prices on the bourse, a fact that to cloud foreign investor perceptions of the Czech market. WARSAW Polish shares on Thursday rose for the sixth consecutive session but analysts said stronger selling after price-fixing showed the market was losing steam and made it unclear if the growth trend would continue. ""It seems we now have a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers,"" said Krzysztof Rogalski, an analyst at Bank Staropolski SA brokerage. But some analysts said a real growth trend had already begun, sparked by firms releasing better July earnings at the start of the week. The WIG index closed at 13,597.4 points, up 892.7 points or 7.0 percent from last Friday's close. Analysts said recent systematic gains in higher turnovers by several large-cap stocks was a good sign that could help return the market toward this year's July 5, 14,282.2-point high next week. BUDAPEST Prices rose at both of this week's sessions as market participants returned after holidays on Monday and Tuesday. The rest of the market strengthened as investors were cheered because the U.S. Federal Reserve had left interest rates steady. ""It's certainly due to the fact the U.S. investors put money into the east European emerging markets,"" Peter Haas of Postabank Securities said. ""Optimism seems to have spread over investors after the danger of a rate hike was eliminated."" The BUX index closed on Thursday at 3,370.23, up 198.79 points over last Friday. BRATISLAVA The Bratislava Stock Exchange (BSE) saw a week of listless holiday trading, with the ongoing struggle for strategic control over the country's largest investment fund, VUB Kupon, dominating floor trading. The 12-share SAX index posted several year-highs over the week, peaking at 226.34 points on Tuesday, and closing at 223.75 points on Thursday, slightly firmer from Monday's open. ""This week was a transparent example, showing how the index is often far off from real trends on the market,"" Dusan Sykora of ING Barings said. ""The SAX has been reaching top levels, while only a few trades were concluded on the bourse on low volumes,"" he added. SOFIA No corporate issues traded for a third week in a row on the Bulgarian stock market as investors turnede their attention to treasuries and foreign currency. Only the Sofia Stock Exchange (SSE) operated this week after the Bulgarian Stock Exchange (BSE) went into a summer recess on August 5. The BSE will resume trading on September 2. The 13-share Reuter All Bulgaria Stock Exchange Index (RABSI) closed at 41.31 points, unchanged from last Thursday. BUCHAREST Romanian share prices posted gains this week on the back of healthy half-year earnings reports by several firms but trading, dominated by retail investors, was modest in volume. Overall turnover fell by almost 30 million lei to 68.5 million on Thursday. The unofficial VAB Index -- a value-weighted index of all stocks computed by Vanguard SA securities -- closed at 371 points, 8.20 points or 3.5 percent up on the week. Its base was 1,000 points when it was created last November. ZAGREB Croatian stocks were mixed though the summer lull seemed to be nearing an end as big buyers became more active, boosting prices and prompting broker predictions of a steady rise in the weeks to come. Most active was Zagrebacka Banka which gained 130 kuna since last Tuesday, but other companies including foodprocessor Podravka also registered an increase of prices.

"The Czech Republic and Spain played out a scoreless draw in their World Cup group six qualifier on Wednesday, in a match that never lived up to expectations. The Czechs were facing their first big test since they reached the Euro 96 final, while Real Madrid's teenage striker Raul was looking to spark a depleted Spanish attack in his first full international. Both sides opened their World Cup campaigns last month with high-scoring victories over the two weakest teams in the group, Spain winning 6-2 in the Faroe Islands and the Czechs thrashing Malta 6-0. But Yugoslavia have already collected three wins and Slovakia two against the same two hapless victims and neither team could afford to give ground in Prague. Like two heavyweights feeling each other out in the early rounds, both teams started tentatively, waiting to pounce on the other's mistakes. The Spaniard's were the first to flinch when Kaiserslautern striker Pavel Kuka's cross found an unmarked Karel Poborsky just outside the crease. But the Manchester United midfielder failed to control the ball, wasting what would turn out be one of the game's few good scoring chances. Next it was the Czechs turn to falter. Newcastle United goalkeeper Pavel Srnicek, winning his first cap in over a year, tried to clear the ball, but hit attacker Alfonso Perez and watched helplessly as it rolled just wide of the net. The Czechs picked up their play in the second half, putting Spain on their heels for the rest of the game. ""I don't think we lost points tonight because they are such an excellent team. They played strongly in the defence and its too bad we missed out on the two great chances we had,"" said Czech striker Patrik Berger.

"Investors smiled on the bourses of central and eastern Europe as brightly as the summer sun this week, though there were some indications these may by little more than fair-weather friends to the markets. Exchanges in Prague, Warsaw, Budapest, Bratislava and Bucharest all gained ground, while Zagreb and Sofia traded mixed. Ljubljana was the one gray cloud, posting slight losses. The Central European Share Index (CESI) which reflects the price movements of 50 selected Czech, Polish and Hungarian shares, firmed 66.11 points. PRAGUE Czech share prices were mostly steady on the Prague Stock Exchange throughout the week, with little movement expected soon as the holiday season slowly winds up. The PX50 index edged up 3.6 points from Monday to close at 568.6 on Thursday. Leading trading were SPT Telecom and Komercni Banka, though SPT's movements were largely characterised as ""accounting procedures"" that saw the issue gain as much as 102 crowns one session, only to lose the same amount the following day. ""The final price (of SPT) was not the real market price, but because average prices are not used for the close, it gives an artificial final number,"" said Jan Sykora of Wood and Company. SPT closed on Thursday at 3,340 crowns. Dealers have long-complained that some market participants consistently manipulate prices on the bourse, a fact that to cloud foreign investor perceptions of the Czech market. WARSAW Polish shares on Thursday rose for the sixth consecutive session but analysts said stronger selling after price-fixing showed the market was losing steam and made it unclear if the growth trend would continue. ""It seems we now have a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers,"" said Krzysztof Rogalski, an analyst at Bank Staropolski SA brokerage. But some analysts said a real growth trend had already begun, sparked by firms releasing better July earnings at the start of the week. The WIG index closed at 13,597.4 points, up 892.7 points or 7.0 percent from last Friday's close. Analysts said recent systematic gains in higher turnovers by several large-cap stocks was a good sign that could help return the market toward this year's July 5, 14,282.2-point high next week. BUDAPEST Prices rose at both of this week's sessions as market participants returned after holidays on Monday and Tuesday. The rest of the market strengthened as investors were cheered because the U.S. Federal Reserve had left interest rates steady. ""It's certainly due to the fact the U.S. investors put money into the east European emerging markets,"" Peter Haas of Postabank Securities said. ""Optimism seems to have spread over investors after the danger of a rate hike was eliminated."" The BUX index closed on Thursday at 3,370.23, up 198.79 points over last Friday. BRATISLAVA The Bratislava Stock Exchange (BSE) saw a week of listless holiday trading, with the ongoing struggle for strategic control over the country's largest investment fund, VUB Kupon, dominating floor trading. The 12-share SAX index posted several year-highs over the week, peaking at 226.34 points on Tuesday, and closing at 223.75 points on Thursday, slightly firmer from Monday's open. ""This week was a transparent example, showing how the index is often far off from real trends on the market,"" Dusan Sykora of ING Barings said. ""The SAX has been reaching top levels, while only a few trades were concluded on the bourse on low volumes,"" he added. SOFIA No corporate issues traded for a third week in a row on the Bulgarian stock market as investors turnede their attention to treasuries and foreign currency. Only the Sofia Stock Exchange (SSE) operated this week after the Bulgarian Stock Exchange (BSE) went into a summer recess on August 5. The BSE will resume trading on September 2. The 13-share Reuter All Bulgaria Stock Exchange Index (RABSI) closed at 41.31 points, unchanged from last Thursday. BUCHAREST Romanian share prices posted gains this week on the back of healthy half-year earnings reports by several firms but trading, dominated by retail investors, was modest in volume. Overall turnover fell by almost 30 million lei to 68.5 million on Thursday. The unofficial VAB Index -- a value-weighted index of all stocks computed by Vanguard SA securities -- closed at 371 points, 8.20 points or 3.5 percent up on the week. Its base was 1,000 points when it was created last November. ZAGREB Croatian stocks were mixed though the summer lull seemed to be nearing an end as big buyers became more active, boosting prices and prompting broker predictions of a steady rise in the weeks to come. Most active was Zagrebacka Banka which gained 130 kuna since last Tuesday, but other companies including foodprocessor Podravka also registered an increase of prices. LJUBLJANA In Ljubljana, share prices, eased 0.4 percent as the SBI index fell 4.31 points to 980.60.

"It's a Snip, bidding to become the ninth horse to win two years in succession in the 106-year history of the Pardubice steeplechase, leads a British raid to this city east of Prague on Sunday. Last year's winner, one of a trio of British horses expected for the controversial four-and-a-quarter mile event (6.9 km), has the considerable advantage from the saddle of Richard Dunwoody, one of the world's most accomplished jump jockeys. The Pardubice, a unique test of man and horse, includes a series of demanding obstacles and has been compared to the Grand National at Aintree, a race Dunwoody has won twice. Race organisers have made the course easier in recent years, including modifying the daunting Taxis jump with its tough, high, wide fence and deep ditch.  This and various other changes among the other 30 jumps followed massive protests and the embarassing 1993 outcome when only one horse managed to finish. A total of 21 horses have died in the Pardubice over the years. Rounding out the trio of British challengers looking to win part of the 2.5 million crown ($92,000) purse are Irish Stamp and Veleda II. Irish Stamp, to be ridden by Norman Williamson, has a clear chance and is rated considerably higher in England than It's a Snip, although the latter's proven ability over the course will be a major factor. Of the others, Polish-trained Scater is also expected to make a bold show. Despite its long history, the Pardubice has only recently regained its former status. ""In the past everyone in Britain knew of the enormously difficult course but they didn't have much interest,"" said Nigel Miller, one of the organisers who has worked to bring the British contingent here. ""But this year, one of the biggest hits of the season is to come here for a two-day trip to one of the most historic races around."" ",AlanCrosby
"East European bourses were mostly higher this week with the Warsaw Stock Exchange leading the way, hitting a 30-month high before easing slightly on profit-taking. Budapest, Zagreb, Bratislava, Ljubljana and Sofia also posted gains, while markets in Prague and Bucharest lost ground in listless trading. The Central European Share Index (CESI), which measures the performance of Prague, Budapest and Warsaw blue-chip stocks, dipped 0.29 percent to 1,486.55 points. WARSAW Polish shares on Friday extended Thursday's falls due to profit-taking, after a four-session, 2.7-percent rise on the back of gains on western bourses. Analysts said the market could slip below 14,800 points before picking up toward the middle of next week as firms release their September earnings reports. ""It looks like we'll have falls for a few sessions, with the first support line at 14,800 points possibly broken,"" said Grzegorz Pindur, an analyst at Bank Staropolski brokerage. The main market's all-share WIG index closed at 14,920.4 points, up 244.5 points or 1.7 percent from Friday's close. PRAGUE The Prague Stock Exchange continued to limp through October, yet to record an advancing session, with little hope in sight for a turnaround as investors shun a market plagued by a lack of transparency. The PX50 index closed at 542.4 on Friday, down 13.1 points, or 2.36 percent. ""I think the budget first reading passing is too weak a signal but it is definitely positive. There are still structural problems to be solved before investors get more confident in this market,"" said Karel Ruzicka of ING Barings. Foreign investors have long-complained that Czech capital markets are plagued by weak securities legislation that allows for secretive transactions. An estimated 70 percent of all market activity takes place off-market. BUDAPEST The Budapest Stock Exchange closed the week at an all-time high, boosted by the release of some positive macroeconomic figures. On Friday the BUX index closed at 3,639.68 points, up 31.67 from last Friday's close. ""Price rises were not very significant but they may mark the beginning of a modestly bullish trend,"" said Robert Agoston of Daewoo Securities. ""These macroeconomic data triggered price increases."" Hungary released wide range of macroeconomic data this week, including the central bank's preliminary current account, trade gap, reserve and inflation data, in addition. BRATISLAVA The Bratislava Stock Exchange (BSE) also suffered through another week of sluggish trading, though a jump on Friday appeared to bear out broker predictions of signs that activity was gradually reviving. The 12-share SAX index fell through the 200 level at mid-week, but then rebounded slightly to close at 203.82 points on Friday, up from Monday's open at 200.32 points. ""We have witnessed some fresh players on our market over the past few days, and the good thing is that the ratio between foreign and domestic investor seems to be well-balanced,"" said Libor Briska of Creditanstalt. BUCHAREST Thin interest from retail investors, who dominate the bourse, drove most share prices down this week. Two independent indices fell to year-lows at both weekly sessions as investors awaited fresh listings to the currently traded 13 stocks. Last week, the bourse said 11 companies had applied for listing but did not say when they would join trading. The VAB index fell 1.5 percent to 291.7 points on Thursday and the BIG index dipped 1.6 percent to 289.98 points. SOFIA Two corporate issues traded higher on the Bulgarian stock market this week amid low investor interest. The 13-share Reuter All Bulgaria Stock Index (RABSI) closed at 41.28 points, up 0.26 from last Thursday due to the rise of RIF' third issue and TBS Hotels second issue. TIRANA Tirana's Stock Exchange this week recorded a 100 million leks transaction in 364-day treasury bills on Monday but no bonds changed hands on Thursday. The Savings Bank sold 100 million leks worth of 364-day T-Bills to the National Commercial Bank on Monday, the first of Tirana's Stock Exchange (TSE) two weekly sessions. The finance ministry on Thursday offered 800 million leks worth of 91-day t-bills, 400 million leks of 182-day t-bills and one billion leks in 364-day t-bills. ZAGREB Croatian stocks forged ahead throughout the week, ending mixed on Friday as selected hoteliers closed slightly lower after recording new highs during the week. Traders said growing supply will stabilise prices next week. LJUBLJANA Slovenian shares jumped 18.5 percent this week, pushing the index up 202.6 points to 1,299.70 as investors snapped up shares of newly-privatised companies.

"Top seed Goran Ivanisevic cruised to a 7-6 6-4 win over Romania's Adrian Voinea in the first round of the Czech Indoor Open on Monday. In the only other match involving a seeded player on the opening day, Britain's Tim Henman overpowered Sweden's Nicklas Kulti 7-6 6-4. Both players took advantage of the fast carpet court, blasting service winner after service winner to demoralise their opponents. Ivanisevic, ranked fifth in the world, started slowly against world number 42 Voinea, before pulling away in the middle of the tie break and never looked back. ""It's always tough to play in a new hall and the carpet here is much faster than last week in Vienna,"" said Ivanisevic who hit 14 aces. ""But this was good preparation though because the tournament has so many top players. To win it will take at least one win over a top 10 player."" Ivanisevic's is scheduled to play the winner of Tuesday's match between Czech Petr Korda and Ecuardor's Nicolas Lapentti and could also have to get past third seed Boris Becker and eighth seeded Czech Bohdan Ulihrach it he is to reach Sunday's final. Henman also used his dominating serve to wear down Kulti. ""It was a tough match but I think I should have taken the first set before the tiebreak,"" said Henman. ""He fought back well but I felt more comfortable in the second set. ""I enjoy playing a tough match right from the start, it focuses you very quickly."" ",AlanCrosby
"Wimbledon champion and fourth seed Richard Krajicek crashed out of the first round of the Czech Indoor Open on Tuesday, losing 6-4 6-3 to Germany's David Prinosil. Second seed Wayne Ferreira of South Africa also had a rough ride but eventually overcame Italy's Renzo Furlan 7-5 4-6 6-3 while sixth seed Michael Stich of Germany cruised past Australian Sandon Stolle 7-6 6-2. Krajicek, whose parents emigrated from then Czechoslovakia to the Netherlands when he was a child, struggled to bring his booming serve under control from the outset, failing to mount a sustained attack against Prinosil, ranked number 58 in the world. ""I'm not very happy with the way I played, and David returned my serve very well, and my second serve was off,"" said Krajicek who served up only seven aces and six double faults. Former Wimbledon champion Michael Stich found the going much easier, taking a close first set before overpowering world number 71 Stolle in the second set. After crashing out of the first round in each of his last two tournaments, world number seven Ferreira looked shaky at times, committing a rash of unforced errors that left the match even after two sets. But another early exit for the South African would have seriously jeopardised his chances of qualifying for the ATP Tour World Championship in Hanover, Germany at the end of the year. ""It's always a tough match against Renzo, he has a game that is suited well against mine,"" said Ferreira, who currently holds the eighth and final spot for Hanover with Boris Becker, scheduled to play in Ostrava on Wednesday, just 46 points behind. Fifth seed Todd Martin easily disposed of Slovakia's Jan Kroslak 6-3 6-4 and eighth seed Bohdan Ulihrach fought back in the last set to defeat his Czech Davis Cup team mate Daniel Vacek 6-2 3-6 7-5.

"Third seed Boris Becker, fresh from his first title since injuring his wrist at Wimbledon, cruised to a 6-3 6-4 victory over Denmark's Frederik Fetterlein in the Czech Indoor Open on Wednesday. Fifth seed Todd Martin also had an easy time in his second round match, downing Italian Cristiano Caratti 6-4 6-1, while eighth seeded Czech Bohdan Ulihrach was not as fortunate, falling 6-4 6-2 to Davis Cup team mate Jiri Novak. A slightly tired-looking Becker, who won the CA Trophy in Vienna on Sunday, looked rusty at times, missing easy volleys. But his booming serve and crisp groundstrokes kept Fetterlein, ranked 129th in the world, permanently on the back foot. ""I have good days and bad days with my hand...it was sore in the match but I managed to fight through it and hopefully it will be alright tomorrow,"" said Becker who needed just over an hour to defeat his opponent. The world number six tried to return to the circuit last month, but recurring problems with the ligament he tore in a third round match at Wimbledon forced him to retire from the first round in Bucharest, lose in the second round in Basle and withdraw from Lyon two weeks ago. His return to form may be just enough to earn the 28-year-old a record 12th appearance at the ATP Tour Championships at the end of the year. Becker currently trails South African Wayne Ferreira, seeded second in Ostrava, by only 46 points for the eighth and final spot in Hanover. Martin, ranked 11th in the world, also had little trouble disposing of Caratti, needing just 49 minutes for his straight sets win. For Ulihrach, meeting a Davis Cup team mate for the second consecutive day proved too much, as he put up little resistance to Novak. The previous day Ulihrach beat Daniel Vacek, ranked one spot below him at 36th, but could not recapture the service return which propelled him into the second round against Novak, ranked 40th.

"Boris Becker withdrew from the Czech Indoor Open on Thursday because of a recurring wrist injury, while top seed Goran Ivanisevic crashed out to Czech Petr Korda 7-6 6-2.

""Boris said his wrist was too sore and that he would not be able to play this evening,"" ATP Tour Supervisor Gayle Bradshaw said. On Wednesday Becker had held his wrist several times during his 6-3 6-4 victory over Denmark's Frederik Fetterlein. The world number six tried to return to the circuit last month but the injury forced him to retire from the first round in Bucharest, lose in the second round in Basle and withdraw from Lyon two weeks ago.

Ivanisevic, who has already qualified for the tour finale, lives and dies by the serve.  But he was outgunned by Korda who served 10 aces and only one double fault, while Ivanisevic managed only nine aces along with five double faults. ""He surprised me the way he played, he served well and returned very well. I double-faulted at 5-5 in the tie break which hurt,"" said Ivanisevic. ""I didn't return well, I didn't take any chances on his second serve. I didn't know whether to stay back or come in and when you're not sure what to do then it's no good."" Second seed Ferreira scraped through to the quarter-finals with a 7-6 5-7 7-5 victory over Dutch qualifier Joost Winnink. Ferreira, ranked seventh in the world, was stretched to the limit by Winnink.

""Boris said his wrist was too sore and that he would not be able to play this evening,"" ATP Tour Supervisor Gayle Bradshaw told Reuters. He did not elaborate. On Wednesday evening, Becker cruised to an easy 6-3 6-4 victory over Denmark's Frederik Fetterlein. During the match he held his wrist several times, and appeared to be favouring it again at practice on Thursday morning. Becker immediately left the training court for his hotel. He was not available for comment ""I have good days and bad days with my hand...it was sore in the match but I managed to fight through it and hopefully it will be alright tomorrow,"" Becker said after the match on Wednesday. The world number six tried to return to the circuit last month, but recurring problems with the wrist forced him to retire from the first round in Bucharest, lose in the second round in Basle and withdraw from Lyon two weeks ago. Becker's withdrawal puts a serious dent in the 28 year old's plans to qualify for a record 12th appearance at the ATP Tour Championships at the end of the year. He currently trails South African Wayne Ferreira, seeded second in Ostrava, by only 46 points for the eighth and final spot in Hannover. It also comes as a blow to tournament organisers. Though he was only ranked third in the tournament behind top seed Goran Ivanisevic and Ferreira, it was clear most of the tickets sold were by fans hoping to catch a glimpse of the German. Barely 1,000 fans came out to watch Ivanisevic's first round match against world number 42 Adrian Voinea. In contrast, a tournament record crowd of some 10,000 watched Becker defeat the Fetterlien, ranked 156 in the world. ",AlanCrosby
"Britain's Tim Henman emerged on Friday as the only seed in the $475,000 Czech Indoor Open semifinals. Seventh-ranked Henman overcame second seed Wayne Ferreira 6-4 6-3. But fifth seed Todd Martin was edged out by Germany's David Prinosil 7-6 7-6 and sixth seed Michael Stich lost to Czech Martin Damm 5-7 6-4 6-4. Czech Petr Korda completed the final four with his 6-1 6-0 demolition of Davis Cup team mate Jiri Novak and now faces another Davis Cup player in Damm. Henman plays Prinosil in Saturday's other semifinal. Reigning Ostrava champion Ferreira, ranked seventh in the world, never looked comfortable against Henman, the more aggressive of the two for most of the match. He failed to gain a single break point all match while the Briton broke serve late in both sets. Henman's win avenged his loss to the South African in Toronto earlier this year, and he said he had taken notes from that match on to court on Friday. ""In Toronto, Ferreira was dictating the points -- serving very well and hitting forehands very well -- so today I tried to be very aggressive and, when I had an opportunity, move forward,"" said Henman, ranked 26 in the world. Local favourite Damm, a finalist at the Beijing Open last week, spoiled Stich's 28th birthday. After losing the first set the Czech scored crucial breaks in the ninth game of the final two sets. For Martin, defeat was especially painful as he could have gained valuable ground on Ferreira in the race for the final spot at the ATP Tour championship in Hanover at the end of the season. The American currently sits 199 points behind the South African. A semifinal berth would have eaten 37 points out of that lead while a place in the finals would have almost halved Ferreira's advantage. Prinosil, ranked 58th in the world, profited from a Martin double fault at 5-5 in the first set tiebreak and took a 4-0 lead in the second set tiebreak on the way to sealing victory. Martin said: ""I realise I didn't help my cause at all but we've got two of the biggest tournaments coming up and I think whoever does really well in those events should probably play themselves into a position at Hanover."" Martin, Stich and Ferreira both appear next week in Stuttgart, where the winner gains 370 Tour points, 200 more than the winner here. The German tournament's organisers said on Friday they expect Boris Becker will be fit to play, despite a wrist injury which forced him to retire here.

"Second seed Wayne Ferreira and fifth seed Todd Martin both went down to straight set defeats in the $475,000 Czech Indoor Open quarterfinals on Friday. In the day's opening match, Ferreira lost 6-4 6-3 to Britain's Tim Henman, seeded seventh in the tournament, while Martin was edged out by Germany's David Prinosil 7-6 7-6. Ferreira, ranked seventh in the world, never looked comfortable against Henman, who was the aggressor for most of the match.

The American currently sits 199 points behind the South African, and a semifinal berth would have eaten 37 points out of the lead, while a place in the finals would have cut Ferreira's advantage by almost half. Prinosil, ranked 58th in the world, took advantage of a Martin double fault at 5-5 in the first set tiebreak, and then jumped out to a 4-0 lead in the second set tiebreak, a hole the American could not pull himself out of. ""I realise I didn't help my cause by at all, but we've got two of the biggest tournaments coming up and I think whoever does really well in those events should probably play themselves into a position at Hannover,"" Martin said. Martin was helped this week by Boris Becker's recurring wrist injury which forced him out of the Ostrava tournament after the first round.

"Germany's David Prinosil ended rising British star Tim Henman's bid for his first ATP Tour victory on Saturday, while Czech Petr Korda halted compatriot Martin Damm's quest for his second final appearance in two weeks. Prinosil beat Henman 6-4 6-3 in the semifinals of the $475,000 Czech Indoor Open and Korda followed with a hard-fought 4-6 6-3 7-5 victory against his Davis Cup team mate. Seventh seed Henman, who had not lost a set all week, looked shaky on his groundstrokes early, but stayed in contention with his strong serve, firing seven of his 11 aces in the first set. But in the 10th game of the match, Henman's serve failed him, his double fault giving the German triple break point. Henman, who has now reached seven semifinals but never gone further, fought back with a service winner and then an ace, but as he has done all week, Prinosil blasted a brilliant return to take the point and set. The British number one recovered to gain two break points of his own in the third game, but failed to come up big when he needed to. Prinosil, who was born near here in Olomouc before emigrating to Germany, then took control. Henman said: ""I didn't serve well at the right times. I felt confident coming into the match, (but) I just didn't really make anything happen today. It was just a case of not really having a good day at the office. ""I'm disappointed to have lost because I thought it was a good opportunity to make my first final. Bar this match, I've played very well this week and am confident going into Stuttgart and Paris."" Prinosil said: ""I served very strongly today and just tried to play within myself, not get too excited and lose my concentration. No matter what happens tomorrow, this tournament has been a great success for me."" Damm also looked on the bright side, viewing his appearance in the final last Sunday in the Beijing Open and this week's march to the semifinals as two of the best weeks of tennis he has ever played. Victimns on the way have included world number three Michael Chang and ex-Wimbledon champion Michael Stich. For Korda the win came as a relief following claims in the local media that he could no longer hold his nerve in big matches. The former world number five has suffered several injuries in the past two years, dropping to 49th in the rankings. ""I felt a lot of pressure at the beginning of the match and I've never seen Martin play that well, but I think I also showed that I am still capable of playing tennis at the highest level,"" said Korda, who won his first tournament in two seasons at the Qatar Open earlier this year.

"Germany's David Prinosil, in a homecoming of sorts, overwhelmed Czech Petr Korda 6-1 6-2 in the final of the $475,000 Czech Indoor Open on Sunday. The 23-year-old German, who was born near here in Olomouc and emigrated to Germany when he was 14, took control of the match from the beginning, keeping Korda off balance with his booming serve and crisp groundstrokes. As was the case all week, Prinosil used his deft return of service as an offensive weapon, seizing on both break points he had to take the first set in just 22 minutes. It was more of the same in the second set, with world number 49 Korda taking more chances, but failing to unsettle the German, who was playing in only his second final on the tour after he won in Newport last year. Korda was on the verge of breaking Prinosil in the fourth game, but the world number 58 blasted four straight service winners to take the game, and then ripped two crosscourt forehands to break in the fifth and seventh games in a match that lasted just 50 minutes.   ""If someone told me I wouldn't lose a set all week, I would have said they were crazy. I don't think I have ever played this well,"" said Prinosil, who enjoyed straight set victories over Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek, American Todd Martin and Briton Tim Henman on his way to the final and a prize of $64,000. Korda said: ""I was a little drained from yesterday's match and he hit the ball well. The points were short, which gave me little chance to take control of the match."" Korda needed two hours late on Saturday to defeat Davis Cup team mate Martin Damm in three sets while Prinosil beat Henman in just 56 minutes. ",AlanCrosby

"The Czech September trade deficit should hold steady at around 14 billion crowns after a 14.7 billion crown monthly deficit in August, a Reuters poll of Czech economists showed on Wednesday. Czech trade figures for the first nine months are scheduled to be released by the Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) at 0900 local time (0700 GMT) on Thursday. Most economists surveyed said they expect steady growth in the deficit and few surprises. ""It's still too early to talk about a period of stabilisation in the deficit, I think that will come in 1997 when imports level off and exports strengthen,"" Boris Gomez, an analyst at ING Barings told Reuters. Whatever the deficit in September, the nine-month trade gap is sure to be a record, after the January-August figure reached 100.9 billion crowns, more than all of the 1995's total shortfall of 95.7 billion crowns. The January-September 1995 trade deficit was 62.3 billion crowns. Most analysts agreed a 13-15 September gap would be in-line with prevailing trends, and on target for the estimated deficit of 150-160 billion crowns. The foreign exchange and money markets are expected to show little reaction over the figures, as long as they do not vary greatly from the estimates. Analysts say the trade balance has been hurt by a downturn in the economies of western Europe earlier in the year, and a the effects of a recovery of demand in western Europe have yet to make an impact. CSU figures show import growth was exceeding export growth by about 15 percent versus just over two percent over the last three months. The government and central bank, however, has repeatedly ruled out a devaluation of the crown to boost exports. Analysts point to mid-1997 as a crucial time in which the import wave -- which is aimed at modernising industries -- must show results in productivity growth and competitiveness.

"The Czech monthly trade deficit eased in September to 10.5 billion crowns from 14.5 billion in August, buoying market sentiment which had not expected the lowest single month total since January. The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) on Thursday said the January-September trade shortfall hit an all-time high of 110.7 billion crowns, far surpassing 1995's full year deficit of 95.7 billion crowns. Despite the fact that the overall deficit continues to break records, analysts said they were surprised by September's development. A Reuters survey of local analysts conducted on Wednesday had forecast a 13-15 billion crown monthly trade gap. ""I'm happily surprised. I think it's a relatively optimistic figure though it is not so good to make us revise our full year forecast,"" said Martin Kupka, an economist at Patria Finance, which has forecast a 150-160 billion crown deficit at year-end. The CSU in a statement said that imports rose by 15.2 percent year-on-year, the same as in the previous month, while exports rose by 5.9 percent, after a 6.4 percent increase in August. It added that strong growth in machinery and transport equipment imports continued, accounting for 38.3 percent of total imports. Analysts said they were encouraged by the rise in this sector, saying that imports of this nature are needed to restructure industry, allowing it to produce more competitive goods for exporting. The crown also reacted positively, dipping slightly following the release of the figures, before quickly regaining its losses as the market digested the statistics. The crown was trading at 26.939 to the dollar at 1040 local time (0840 GMT) after opening at 26.945.

"Czech telephone operator SPT Telecom a.s. on Thursday said its nine-month gross profit hit 6.0 billion crowns, in line with analysts predictions and likely to have little effect on the firm's share price. SPT said in a statement that revenues for the first three quarters totalled 23.3 billion crowns, nearly equal to the 26.4 billion crowns in total revenues for 1995. SPT's 1995 full year gross profit was 7.0 billion crowns. All figures are calculated according to International Accounting Standards (IAS). SPT shares closed down six crowns at 2,879 on the Prague Stock Exchange on Thursday, though dealers said the results came out after trading ended for the day. ""The figures were basically in line with our estimates. Margins are pretty much the same as they were in the first half so I think the company is in a good position for future growth,"" said Alex Marcek an analyst at Patria Finance. The statement added the number of lines installed accelerated in the third quarter, putting the year-to-date figure at 272,000 lines and the overall installed base at 2.67 million lines. ""The company is confident that it will achieve its 1996 target of over 400,000 new set lines,"" the statement said. SPT, of which a Dutch-Swiss consortium comprised of PTT Netherlands and Swiss Telecom bought a 27 percent stake last summer, is aiming to increase the network by another 500,000 lines in 1997, and 650,000 in 1998. The statement said that investment expenditures for the first nine months totalled more than 20 billion crowns, ""more than the full year 1995 capital expenditure. ""If they hit the target of 400,000 new lines it would be a pretty good base as far as revenues are concerned,"" said one local telecom analyst. Analysts said that the figures would probably not have an immediate effect on SPT's share price, since the entire Czech capital market is in a downturn as investors avoid a market they characterise as plagued with a lack of transparency. Company officials have been adamant that SPT would not pay a dividend before 1998, as profits would still have to be ploughed back into the network's modernisation. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ",AlanCrosby

In a statement, the company said revenues  totalled 23.3 billion crowns, nearly equal to the 26.4 billion crowns for 1995. SPT said outlays for investment in the nine-month period exceeded 20 billion crowns or more than the total for 1995. A Dutch-Swiss consortium of PTT Netherlands and Swiss Telecom, which bought a 27 percent stake in SPT from the government last summer, has effective day-to-day control of the firm. The consortium paid $1.32 billion for its stake. SPT said it installed more telephone lines in the Czech Republic in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date figure to 272,000 lines. SPT now has a total of 2.67 million lines. ""The company is confident that it will achieve its 1996 target of over 400,000 new set lines,"" the statement said. The company is aiming to increase its network by another 500,000 lines in 1997, and 650,000 in 1998. SPT is the only telephone line operator in the country. There are also two GSM mobile phone operators, but they do not install hard lines. ""If they hit the target of 400,000 new lines it would be a pretty good base as far as revenues are concerned,"" said one local telecom analyst. SPT shares closed down six crowns at 2,879 in after-bourse trading in Prague. The company didn't comment on its dividend policy. SPT has said in the past that it doesn't plan to pay a dividend before 1998. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ",AlanCrosby
"A Czech central bank scheme to buy doubtful debts of smaller banks and restore stability to the banking sector has attracted interest from about 10 banks, the Czech news agency reported on Wednesday. CTK, quoting central bank spokesman Martin Svehla, said that of the 13 banks allowed to participate in the plan, the number that had expressed an interest in joining ""is nearing 10"". Central bank officials were not immediately available for comment. The Czech National Bank (CNB) outlined the programme in mid-October followed the failure of Kreditni Banka in August -- the 11th bank in which the CNB had intervened -- and the politicisation of the case which had undermined confidence especially in small banks. Under the plan, participating banks must follow strict conditions and allow the central bank to make management changes where needed. CNB officials said the programme was not aimed at resolving a problem at any one bank. The plan will be open to all small private banks with total paid-in capital of 12.5 billion crowns ($458.5 million) and total assets of not more than 30 billion crowns. The state-run Konsolidacni Banka would buy the banks' doubtful assets at face value. The banks will be required to buy back the assets after around five to seven years, again priced at their nominal value, minus credits recovered by Konsolidacni from the debtors in the meantime. Banks seeking to participate will be held to strict requirements which include sticking to a three-year stabilisation plan and an agreement to attain an eight percent capital adequacy ratio. Banks also must maintain cost controls, profitability and liquidity as well as agreeing to frequent reviews by the central bank. The maximum purchase of debt by Konsolidacni can total up to 110 percent of a single bank's paid-in capital, meaning a maximum exposure for the state of 13.7 billion crowns in total if all eligible banks participated. The programme is voluntary based on a contract with the CNB, and the central bank said it would not reveal which banks elected to participate. Banks eligible include Ekoagrobanka, Union Banka, Evrobanka, Prvni Mestska Banka, COOP Banka, Pragobanka, Plzenska Banka, Foresbank, Bankovni Dum Skala, Moravia Banka, Universal Banka, Zemska Banka, and Banka Hana. Money for the scheme is to come primarily from state- controlled Konsolidacni Banka and if necessary from the CNB itself. A newly created unit of Konsolidacni, Ceska Financni s.r.o., will administer the programme. Any losses from the programme are to be covered by the National Property Fund (NPF), the state privatisation agency. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ",AlanCrosby
"Investors, fed up with a lack of transparency and the poor performance of the Czech equity market, are turning to the country's less opaque debt market, buoyed by favourable interest rates and economic data. The Prague bourse has been caught in a downward spiral -- the official PX50 index has lost almost 18 percent in the past two months -- that analysts say won't end before the New Year. But while bears maul the equities market, they say bulls are quietly finding greener pastures in Czech debt. ""The bond market is pretty bullish and the outlook is good. Rates have been tending down and people are positive especially in the longer maturities which are looking more attractive,"" said Michael Gartner, a debt analyst at ING Capital Markets. Estimated daily bond turnover has grown to 900 million to one billion crowns, equal to turnover on the Prague stock exchange, from 500 million a year ago. ""The bond market is becoming even more important for foreign investors because they can get reasonable prices,"" said Alojz Lacko, a bond trader at Patria Finance. Reasonable prices are something investors, foreign and domestic, have long complained they cannot find on the equities market where insufficient legislation has pushed an estimated 70 percent of trading into murky off-market dealing, and trampled minority shareholder rights. Many strategic and speculative investors have taken advantage of the opaque system to buy up large stakes in firms without prices or counter-parties being made public until long after the deal has been made. Bourse and Finance Ministry officials have stepped up their campaign in recent months to assure investors tighter, more stringent rules for trading will be introduced. But analysts say the moves appear to be too little, too late for investors who are turning away from Czech equities. ""Investors are really put off by the (trading) practices here and frankly, it will be hard to lure some back. But we don't have these problems in the debt market, and a lot are turning their attentions there,"" said one local trader. ING's Gartner said investor motivation for entering the debt market is in many ways different from equity investments. Investor fears of having the carpet pulled out from under them by an off-market takeover deal are non-existent. ""The bond market is completely transparent because prices are transparent. It's a good market: it works, it's liquid, foreign investors, domestic investors, pension funds, investment funds all participate on an even field,"" he said. A recent spate of positive economic indicators has further buoyed the market. Inflation, one of the lowest in the region, eased further in October with the year-on-year rate standing at 8.7 percent. The central bank's war on a burgeoning money supply has also borne fruit recently, with the expansion of the key M2 year-on-year rate falling to 13.2 percent at the end of August, just below its 14-17 percent target. Although investor sentiment has traditionally been bearish on East European bonds because of currency risks, high taxation and political and economic instability, analysts say these factors are less significant in the Czech Republic. While rates may be higher in neghbouring Poland and Hungary, the markets are very illiquid, especially in local currency corporate issues. But with the strength and stability of the crown the Czech market is attractive because an investor can add a play on the local currency, and have little fear of currency risk since it is tied closely to the mark. Traders say the government has also helped by easing currency exchange laws to help foreign investors repatriate their holdings. Foreigners may repatriate interest income on bonds as well as income from selling or redeeming them. -- Prague newsroom (42 2) 24 23 0003 ",AlanCrosby
"Czech paper concern Sepap Group a.s. on Friday said its nine-month net profit fell as a shutdown of its main paper mill, coupled with a downturn in the paper cycle bit into its bottom line. Sepap said its nine-month net profit, calculated according to international accounting standards, fell to 188.4 million crowns from 520.4 million over the same period in 1995, while revenues slumped to 3.94 billion crowns from 5.34 billion. The firm said results from the third quarter only had stabilised after a first half industry downtrend, though ""the planned annual shutdown of the Steti mill lowered earnings by virtue of the expected higher maintenance costs associated with the stoppage"". ""Overall, Sepap year-end ernings are expected to rise and show a slight improvement over third quarter levels,"" a company statement said. The Steti mill, which accounts for some three-quarters of the group's revenues and profits, saw its pre-tax profits plummet to seven million crowns. Comparative figures were not immediately available, but the mill's nine-month 1995 gross profit was some 95 million crowns. ""The market place is sending mixed signals for the fourth quarter.

"Czechs cold-shouldered their newly-created Senate on Saturday, turning out in record low numbers for elections which were supposed to be a key test for the minority government of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. Early results showed candidates of Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) ahead in the few constituencies declared so far but without the majority of the vote needed to win outright, meaning they will face the runner-up in a second round. Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec, an ODS vice chairman, welcomed the results but warned supporters against overconfidence. ""I'm very happy that several of our candidates have moved into the next round,"" he told reporters. But he added: ""I warn you, add up all the votes for all of the candidates and think how they will go in the second round. The situation is not as rosy as it may appear from the numbers of ODS candidates that are moving into the next round."" With three of the 81 constitunecies officially declared, the striking statistic was the turnout figure which ranged from 26.36 percent in the northern mining town of Most to 29.78 in one constituency in the industrial city of Ostrava. One official of the Central Electoral Commission, Ales Kaspar, forecast that turnout nationwide would be by far the lowest in the four parliamentary elections held since the 1989 fall of communism. ""According to optimistic expectations, the turnout could be between 30 and 40 percent,"" he told Reuters. This suggested the real winners might not be ODS or the opposition Social Democrats, but the far-right Republicans who boycotted the Senate polls and told Czechs to follow suit. Opposition Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman bewailed Czechs' apathy towards the upper house, but predicted turnout would improve in the second round on November 22-23. ""I would like to remind all voters who criticise our country that by not voting they do not have the right to criticise the government. They have only the right to criticise themselves,"" said Zeman, who is speaker of the lower house. But he added: ""I firmly believe that in the second round, participation will be markedly higher because then it is a choice between the two strongest candidates,"" he said. Share dealers welcomed signs that ODS, which has led free-market reform in recent years, would do well. ""The early results appear pleasantly good for ODS. To me, if these continue, it could be a good result for the market,"" said Jan Sykora of Prgaue brokerage Wood and Co. Pundits have billed the Senate elections as an indicator of whether the Czech Republic can break out of a political impasse following inconclusive lower house polls which stripped Klaus's conservative coalition of its majority last June. But the apparent low turnout, which compares with 76.4 percent in June, seems a vindication of the Republicans and their leader Miroslav Sladek. Sladek regards the Senate as a waste of time and money. ""They had nowhere to dump the political zombies so they established the Senate,"" he told a recent anti-election rally, adding that it ""would be lazy, useless and expensive"". One complaint among voters was that many of the Senate candidates were unknown as government and opposition leaders all sit in the lower Chamber of Deputies. Few Czechs have much idea of what the Senate will do. Conventional wisdom has been that if ODS did well in the Senate Klaus might provoke early lower house polls to regain the coalition's majority. If ODS lost to the Social Democrats, however, he could be forced to resign after seven years leading economic reform as finance minister and since 1992 as premier. But Jiri Pehe, research director at the Open Media Research Institute (OMRI), said these theories may not be valid. ODS is better at mobilising its supporters than the Social Democrats when interest is low. A big ODS win on a low turnout might therefore not be representative for lower house polls. ""If there is a low turnout, even if Klaus wins, I think that it would be very difficult for the ODS to know the real mood of the country,"" he said. -- Prague newsroom (42 2) 24 23 0003 ",AlanCrosby

The apathy suggested that the real winners might not be Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) or the opposition Social Democrats, but the far-right Republicans who boycotted the Senate elections and told fellow Czechs to follow suit. Unofficial figures from the two-day first round, which ended on Saturday, indicated that turnout would be well under 40 percent, by far the lowest in the four parliamentary elections held since the 1989 fall of communism. Opposition Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman bewailed Czechs' apathy towards the upper house, but predicted that turnout would improve in the second round on November 22-23. ""I think that no party can be happy with the low election turnout, because people that don't turn out for the Senate elections are giving up their civic rights, the right to vote, the right to decide,"" Zeman told reporters. No national figures were available immediately after the polls closed at 2.00 p.m. (1300 GMT). But preliminary, unofficial data from some of the 81 constituencies showed Klaus's centre-right ODS doing well against a bleak background on turnout. In the Western city of Plzen, turnout was just 36 percent with the ODS candidate expected to face a Social Democrat in the second round, the Czech news agency CTK reported. If no candidate wins more than half the vote in the first round, the top two candidates go through to the runoff.

"Czech equity and forex markets pushed higher on Monday, buoyed by a strong showing by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's rightwing Civic Democratic Party (ODS) in the first round of Senate elections at the weekend. But analysts warned profit taking and uncertainty leading up to a second round of voting this weekend will temper gains. The Prague Stock Exchange, mired in a two-month long slump that has felled the bourse by some 16 percent, jumped 10.1 points, or 2.08 percent, at its daily price fixing to 496.8. Brokers expressed muted optimism at the prospect that the rise was long-term, saying that domestic investors looking for a quick rise to profit from, and not key foreign investors were at the heart of the gain. ""There is very little foreign institutional buying as a result of the elections. It's mainly domestic buying. This was just the first round and the (vote) isn't won yet,"" said Jan Sykora of the brokerage Wood and Co. Lubomir Vystavel of ING Barings added: ""We had expected some speculation on the outcome of the elections. Vystavel said the upsurge could continue into next week and beyond if ODS sustains its strong position in the second and final round next weekend, adding that the results may give cause for the long awaited rebound in Czech equities. ""It is quite likely that this is the start of a trend,"" he said. The crown also strengthened on the back of the election result, gaining around 0.3 percentage points to three percent above its dollar/mark basket in early trading, before settling at around +2.9 percent. ""Some of those who pushed the crown up in early dealing took profits, so its dropped slightly on the index,"" said Petr Korous, a trader at Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka. ""There will be some bias toward a stronger crown in the coming days but I don't think there will be any major move -- the majority of the move was seen already today,"" he added. The central bank fixed the crown at 2.96 percent above the basket midpoint on Monday, after fixing it at +2.45 percent on Friday. In what was billed as a key test of the minority coalition government, Klaus's ODS party took a commanding 36.47 percent of the first round vote, with the opposition Social Democrats (CSSD) trailing on 20.27 percent. The result was a major improvement for the ODS, which won only 29.6 percent in elections to the lower house in June when a strong Social Democrat performance of 26.4 percent stripped Klaus's three-party coalition of its majority. The rest of the vote was thinly split among coalition parties and the Communists. The strong ODS showing was tempered though by poor turnout as only 35 percent of the electorate voted. Of the 81 Senate seats, Civic Democrats won three outright in the first round and 76 of their candidates go into next weekend's runoff. The CSSD meanwhile, will send only 48 candidates into the second round of voting slated for Friday afternoon and Saturday morning. ",AlanCrosby
"The Czech capital market, roundly criticised for a lack of transparency, needs an independent regulator, but it is not a panacea for all of the market's woes, a senior Finance Ministry official said on Tuesday. ""Let's not be seduced by the illusion that as soon as an independent securities committee is created that the Czech capital market will become more refined overnight,"" Jan Veverka of the ministry's capital markets supervisory department told a conference in the Czech capital. ""All it (the body) will do is create better conditions for the changes which can contribute to the market's gradual refinement,"" he added. Both foreign and domestic investors have complained that poor legislation and a lack of enforcement of rules that do exist make the Czech capital market one of Eastern Europe's most opaque. The soured outlook by investors has helped pull the Prague Stock Exchange down some 16 percent over the past two months, with predictions of further losses if rules do not change quickly. One of the biggest problems is that legislation allows for near complete secrecy of off-market deals -- where an estimated 70 percent of trading takes place -- making it difficult for investors to determine fairly-valued shares prices. Veverka said when the laws governing securities trading here were devised ""parliament...discarded the concept of regulation which would have given broad powers to the embryonic supervisory system out of fear that it might have abused these powers and impeded the process of creating a market economy"". Coupled with this, he said, was the need to allow for a flood of ownership changes in the market as the mass voucher privatisation put shares in nearly 2,000 firms onto the market in a matter of months. Now, he said, rules must be put in place to shift trading toward the main markets to bring about more transparency. ""Where trading takes place can be changed most effectively by ensuring an increase in the quality of the market's services and an end to the conditions which enable the kind of trading which is characterised by large price discrepancies,"" he said. Veverka called for a raising of the debate on creating a U.S.-style SEC oversight body ""to a much higher level and preparations should be made for the creation of this body"". But he added: ""Monitoring deals and indentifying suspicious prices or other phenomena indisputably belongs to the work of the stock market, and the market must act as a strong support to the supervisory work of the independent committee"". -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ",AlanCrosby
"Senate runoff elections on Friday and Saturday should have little impact on Czech capital markets, as investors focus on macroeconomic fundamentals, not political influences. Analysts said last weekend's first round of voting gave a mild boost to the Czech crown and the Prague Stock Exchange, and unless results from the second round of voting on Friday and Saturday vary greatly, little further boost should be seen. ""Provided that nothing drastic happens, it's pretty much a non-starter from a foreign investor point of view. I think that for the markets, it will be pretty much a non-event,"" Jay King, of Wood and Company, told Reuters. In the first round of voting last weekend, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's right-wing Civic Democratic Party (ODS) posted a strong result, capturing over 36.5 percent of the national vote, an increase of some six percent from June lower house elections where his coalition lost its majority. The opposition Social Democrats were second with 20.3 percent. The rest of the vote was thinly split among coalition parties and the Communists but only 35 percent of the electorate voted. Of the 81 Senate seats, the ODS won three outright in the first round and 76 of their candidates go into the runoff, compared with 48 for the CSSD. In 47 constituencies, the runoff is a straight fight between the two main parties. Analysts said that with the two main parties assured of dominating the Senate, a body which will have limited powers anyway, little change appears imminent for the country's economic, or political course. ""Our expectation is ODS gaining somewhere around half of the total, and including the rest of the coalition it might be well over 50 seats.

Following last weekend's vote, the PSE, mired in a two month long slump began to edge higher, gaining some four percent over the week.

"Sweden beat the Czech Republic 3-0 in a World Cup ice hockey game on Thursday, setting up a showdown for European group supremacy against Finland and leaving the reigning world champions searching for answers. The fast-skating Swedes seized control of the game from the opening faceoff, forcing the Czechs to take several early penalties and keeping its vaunted offense in check. Toronto Maple Leaf winger Mats Sundin opened the scoring midway through the first period when he sped around the Czech defense and pulled Dallas Stars' goalie Roman Turek across the crease before sliding the puck between the netminder's legs. The Swedish National Hockey League (NHL) connection struck again early in the second frame when Washington Capital defenseman Calle Johansson blasted a slapshot from the blue line past a screened Turek with only 57 seconds gone. Turek, voted best goalie at the world championships for the past two years, was once again screened when a weak shot from Jonas Bergqvist found the bottom corner of the net to close out the scoring for the undefeated Swedes. The Czechs came into the tournament riding high after capturing the world title in Vienna in May, but have lost the first two games of the tournament and are in danger of crashing out despite having their version of the ""Dream Team"". With the addition of Pittsburgh Penguins duo Jaromir Jagr and Petr Nedved, Montreal Canadiens sharpshooter Martin Rucinsky and the core of the world championship team in tact, the Czechs were looking to prove they belonged at the pinnacle of the hockey world. The match at Prague's Sports Hall was to be a homecoming of sorts for the Czechs, their first home game since beating Canada 3-2 in a thrilling world championship final on a last minute goal. But after a demoralising loss to Finland in its tournament opener on Tuesday, and another listless effort on Thursday, Czech fans had had enough, pelting the Czech bench with beer cans near the end of the game. Even Czech coach Ludek Bukac, a veteran coach with almost 30 years behind the bench, was left searching for an answer to his sputtering offense and the team's lack of dynamism. ""The Swedes played well, you've got to hand it to them. But the fact that we didn't score at home is not a very good showing,"" he said. Added Jagr: ""We aren't that bad, but our performance is not showing it."" Bukac, who has often expressed his disdain for bringing in players who have talent but not team spirit refused to comment on whether he would invite the same team back if he could do it all again. But with nine players on the roster with seven or less of national team games under their belts, the Czech players know they must come together quickly, or face the embarassment of failing to win in what is touted as the true battle for hockey supremacy. ""We've got to concentrate on winning against Germany and moving on to the next round, nothing else,"" added Robert Reichel, who recently re-signed with the Calgary Flames after playing one year in Germany. The win allows Sweden to keep pace with group leaders Finland, who have also won both their games so far but have a better goal difference. The two teams meet on Sunday in Stockholm while the Czechs must regroup and beat winless Germany in Garmisch-Partenkirchen on Saturday to move into the quarterfinals next week in North America.

"The party of right-wing Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus took a solid lead in Senate election run-offs on Saturday, but turnout was dismal despite an appeal to vote from President Vaclav Havel. With almost half the 81 constituencies declared, Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) had won 19 seats in the new upper house, ahead of the opposition Social Democrats with eight. The Christian Democrats, a junior partner in Klaus's centre-right coalition, put in a strong perfomance to take seven while the third party in the government, the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) won two. Turnout was just 30.5 percent, lower even than the 35 percent recorded in the first round of the Senate polls on November 15 and 16, the Central Election Commission said. Before the second round, Havel appealed to Czechs to turn out in far greater numbers for the sake of the credibility of the new upper house. The Senate elections had been billed as key to the future of Klaus's coalition, which lost its lower house majority in elections six months ago. But analysts say that with turnout so low, the Senate results have little significance. Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik, an ODS member, forecast that the government parties would take control of the Senate. ""It is clear that the coalition is leading at the moment and I think they still will be after the final results are out,"" Kocarnik told reporters, predicting that the ODS would win between 33 and 40 seats. Analysts had forecast that voter apathy would benefit the ODS which is well-organised and well-funded by big business. Its supporters, largely more affluent Czechs who have benefited from Klaus's free market reforms since the 1989 fall of communism, have been galvanised by the coalition's loss of its majority in the lower Chamber of Deputies in June. Klaus, an architect of economic reform, repeatedly accused the Social Democrats of conspiring with the little-reformed communists to turn back the clock on reform. Scepticism is widespread among Czechs and Klaus himself has questioned the need for the Senate, which was written into the Czech Republic's new constitution when Czechoslovakia split at the end of 1992, but is only now being elected. The Social Democrats have said they would scrap the Senate if they ever achieved the three-fifths majority in the lower Chamber of Deputies needed to change the constitution. Klaus toned down his scepticism as voting neared but only Havel has appeared enthusiastic about the idea. Before the run-offs -- for the top two first round candidates in constituencies where no one won more than half the vote -- Havel appealed to citizens to turn out in much greater numbers for the sake of the Senate's legitimacy. -- Prague newsroom (42 2) 24 23 0003 ",AlanCrosby
"The three-party coalition of right-wing Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus won a majority of seats on Saturday in run-off elections to parliament's new upper house, the Senate. But the premier's own party won fewer seats than expected after dominating the first round last week and voter turnout was dismal despite an appeal for Czechs to cast their ballots from President Vaclav Havel. With all 81 constituencies declared, the coalition parties secured 52 seats in the Senate, the very existence of which many Czechs have questioned. The result marked a turnaround for the coalition, central Europe's last centre-right government, which lost its majority in the more powerful lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, six months ago. Klaus's own Civic Democratic Party (ODS) won 32 seats ahead of the strongest opposition party, the Social Democrats, with 25. The Christian Democrats, a junior coalition partner, took take 13 seats while the third party in the government, the Civic Democratic Alliance, won seven. The little-reformed Communists clinched two seats and two went to independents. ""I welcome the fact that the governing coalition took two-thirds of the senatorial seats, and that's a huge victory over the opposition,"" said Klaus, who sits in the lower house along with all other government ministers. ""The result in the second round isn't any surprising victory, but on the other hand the real fact that ODS has about 40 percent of the senators I would have to mark as successful."" The Central Election Commission reported that second round turnout was around 30 percent, lower even than the 35 percent registered in the first round held on November 15-16. The centre-left Social Democrats, whose strong gains in June lower house elections stripped the coalition's majority, were saved the embarassment of a Senate dominated solely by their arch-rivals from Klaus's party. ""I am pleased that Senate will be a place of democratic discussion, and never the place of arrogant domination of one or another political party,"" Milos Zeman, the chairman of the Social Democrats and the lower house, told reporters. Zeman's party has been beset by internal bickering since June, but the results of the run-offs -- between the top two first-round candidates in constituencies where nobody won more than half the vote -- could have been worse for the opposition. ""Most importantly the Senate won't be one-coloured or two-coloured as was expected, but multi-coloured,"" said analyst Jiri Pehe of Prague's Open Media Research Institute. Before the second round, Havel appealed to Czechs to turn out in far greater numbers for the sake of the credibility of the new upper house but opinion surveys showed many had no interest. The Senate elections had been billed as key to the future of Klaus's coalition. But analysts say that with turnout so low, the Senate results have little significance. Klaus, an architect of economic reform, repeatedly accused the Social Democrats of conspiring with the Communists to turn back the clock on reform, and his supporters were galvanised by the coalition's June setback.

"A strong showing in runoff Senate elections at the weekend may breathe new life into the Czech governing coalition, but it will do little to resuscitate the country's dormant capital market, analysts said on Sunday. The minority coalition of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus took 52 of 81 seats in the newly-created upper house of parliament, following the second round of voting, well ahead of the centre-left opposition Social Democrats which took 25 seats. The Senate is a mostly advisory body with limited legislative powers, but the election was the first test at the polls for Klaus since his coalition lost its lower house majority in general elections in June. But analysts said that while the news could have been worse for investors, the strong centre-right showing does nothing to solve the maladies which continue to plague the market. ""I think the market's reaction will be fairly positive, but in a few weeks time it will probably have settled down into acknowledging that this has not changed the situation of the past four or five months at all,"" Charles Robinson of the research house HILFE told Reuters. ""It has just not made it worse,"" he added. The coalition's strong showing in the first round of voting last week helped spur domestic investor interest, pushing the market up in its wake. Analysts said, however, that with this fillip already built into prices, stocks will probably not rise too much further in the near future. The Czech crown also gained some ground against its dollar/mark basket on the back of the first round results, but it too should not rise significantly on the final outcome of the vote, they added. ""It seems that the final results of the elections reflect the current structure of the political situation here so I don't expect any significant changes or amy development as a result of it,"" said Miroslav Nosal of Patria Finance. Analysts said that until legislation is tightened to bring about more market transparency and stronger minority shareholder protection, key foreign investor interest will remain low. ""I think there has been a result built into the market from the good Senate results last week, and everyone expected that the coalition would win this second round,"" said one analyst. ""There are still other difficulties that will keep the market relatively depressed such as a lack of regulation that will keep foreign investors away. This is a more important issue over the medium-term than the Senate elections."" ",AlanCrosby
"The Prague Stock Exchange hit a new year-high on Thursday as major banking issues broke out of a recent slump to spur the bourse higher. Komercni Banka and Ceska Sporitelna, the country's two largest banks both posted strong gains to help push the PX50 index up 3.3 points, or 0.58 percent, to a 1996 high of 574.9. Overall, advancing issues narrowly outpaced decliners by 320 to 298, with 192 holding steady. Total volume remained steady at 916,194 shares on turnover of 648.3 million crowns. Komercni, a likely recipient of attention from investors looking to enter the Czech market after an announcement of its inclusion into the Morgan Stanley index, jumped 99 crowns to close at 2,439. Meanwhile, savings bank Ceska Sporitelna also posted a strong gain of 16 crowns to 351. ""The inclusion of the Czech Republic in the Morgan Stanley index should help boost issues like Komercni,"" said Jan Sykora of the brokerage Wood and Company. Earlier in the day, Sporitelna CEO Jaroslav Klapal announced the bank expects 1996 net profit to total 2.1 billion crowns, while gross profit will hit at least 6.1 billion. Klapal added that he expected the bank would pay a higher dividend in 1996 than its five crown per share dividend for last year. ""Gross profit, before the creation of reserves and payment of taxes could be slightly above 6.1 billion crowns,"" Klapal said. ""We are counting on dividends for this year will be higher than that of last year."" Sporitelna's 1995 after-tax profit, calculated according to Czech accounting standards, plummetted to 263 million crowns from a previous 980 million crowns after the bank provisioned heavily for risky loans. The bank's 1995 gross profit was 9.17 billion crowns but the bank assigned almost an identical sum, 9.13 billion, to its reserves covering ""classified"" loans -- those whose likelihood of recovery ranges from doubtful to hopeless. Klapal did not say whether his forecasts were calculated according to Czech or international accounting standards, which vary mainly in terms of allowable write-offs and depreciation costs. Even though analysts agreed that the financial situation of the bank was markedly better this year than it was last year, they said shares of the bank were overvalued. Analysts say they are closely watching what appears to be a strong acquisition of shares in Sporitelna by the usually secretive Czech investment group Motoinvest and the rival bank Investicni a Postovni Banka a.s. ""The attractiveness of (Sporitelna) could greatly drop if Motoinvest took a more significant share in management,"" said Richard Podpiera analyst at the investment house Atlantk FT. ",AlanCrosby

"The Czech trade deficit jumped sharply in October, rising nearly 16 billion crowns, but analysts said they were not alarmed by the rise which is inline with their full year forecasts. The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) said on Tuesday the trade gap for the first 10 months of the year hit a record 125.5 billion crowns, up from a revised 109.6 billion crown shortfall for January-September. The CSU, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, and most analysts, however, have predicted the deficit -- accelerated by an economic slowdown with the country's main trading partner, Germany -- will finish at a record 150-160 billion crowns. ""The figures are developing according to forecasts. It's clear that the year-end deficit will be 150-160 billion crowns,"" said Kamil Janacek, chief economist at Komercni Banka. ""I'm not surprised by the jump since the economic revival of Germany will only show up in export growth in the first half of next year, not in one or two months,"" he added. The CSU in a statement said that imports rose by 14.4 percent year-on-year for the 10-month period, down from 15.2 percent for January to September, while exports rose by 5.2 percent, down from 5.9 percent for the first nine months. It added that strong growth in machinery and transport equipment imports continued, growing by 19.1 percent year- on-year and accounting for 38.3 percent of total imports. Analysts said they were encouraged by the rise in this sector, saying that imports of this nature are needed to restructure industry, allowing it to produce more competitive goods for exporting. ""The trend seems unchanged. The financing of future economic growth is being done with imports, especially in the heavy machinery sector,"" Boris Gomez, an analyst at ING Barings told Reuters. Added Martin Kupka of Patria Finance:""The country is still clamoring for machinery and raw materials which are necessary for industrial restructuring."" Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, a monetarist-economist, has said the record trade deficit is ""not tragic"" saying it has come in part from a temporary foreign investment wave.

"Financial services and property group Liberty International vowed on Thursday to change the way the British pensions market works with the launch of a new user-friendly subsidiary. ""The market is poised for change, requiring a fresh approach, and our company will provide this by demystifying pensions for everybody - both individuals and the companies for which they work,"" Liberty chairman Donald Gordon said. Liberty has set up its own pensions company, Liberty International Pensions, and will target retail pensions and money purchase pension schemes -- pensions where the benefit is linked to the amount an individual has put in. Liberty, 69 percent owned by South Africa's Liberty Life, has enrolled the giant British Telecom Pension Scheme, which will pay five million pounds ($7.8 million) for 10 percent of the equity of Liberty International Pensions. Liberty's Gordon said the move into the British pensions market was an extension of a worldwide shift from defined benefit -- where an individual's pension is related to his final salary -- to defined contribution principles. This would have ""a most profound influence on business practice and retirement savings in the future"". In Britain there is also ""an urgent and growing need for quality privatised retirement savings which require a radical change in approach and funding techniques"", Gordon added. A rapidly ageing population and low birth rate were combining to increase this need, Gordon said. Liberty also announced it had teamed up with fund management group Hermes to form Hermes Liberty International Pensions. This will offer specialised investment services to the British pensions industry, with Hermes as fund manager. BT Pension Scheme is giving the Hermes Liberty joint venture ""critical mass from the outset"" with a 1.5 billion pound transfer of assets to the new funds, Gordon said. He said Hermes' expertise in investment management and track record would help the group to provide quality and competitively priced pension services. Hermes called the joint pensions venture a meeting of minds. ""Liberty has the ability and techniques of selling pensions, it also has the systems...and the administration. We on the other hand are good at our particular core areas of investment management...we think that's a very good marriage,"" Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Hermes, said. ""It really was a meeting of minds on this. Whether it develops further from this we shall see. I think one step at a time is quite enough for us."" He said the venture would probably not be up and running until the first quarter of next year as regulatory approval first had to be obtained for the new group. As well as selling pensions directly by telephone, Liberty also plans to sell personal pensions at its regional shopping centres, which are held through a majority-owned subsidiary Capital Shopping Centres. These have more than 150 million customer visits a year, Liberty said. ($1=.6395 Pound) ",AlexanderSmith
"Financial services and property group Liberty International Holdings on Thursday unveiled a move into the British pensions market in ventures involving the British Telecom Pension Scheme and pension fund management group Hermes. Liberty is establishing its own pensions company, Liberty International Pensions, which will target both the needs of money purchase pension schemes and retail pensions. BT Pension Scheme, which owns Hermes, is to pay five million pounds ($7.8 million) for 10 percent of the equity of Liberty International Pensions, with the rest held by Liberty. Liberty and Hermes said in a joint statement they were also setting up a new subsidiary called Hermes Liberty International Pensions to offer specialised investment services to the British pensions industry, with Hermes as fund manager. BT Pension Scheme is giving the Hermes Liberty joint venture ""critical mass from the outset"" with a 1.5 billion pound transfer of assets to the new funds, Liberty's chairman Donald Gordon said. Gordon said Liberty was ""well positioned to take advantage of the changes affecting the UK pensions industry."" Hermes' expertise in investment management and track record would help it to provide quality and competitively priced pension services. David Fischel, Liberty's managing director, said Liberty International Pensions still required approval of Britain's Department of Trade and Industry but was otherwise ready for launch. Hermes called the joint pensions venture a meeting of minds. ""Liberty has the ability and techniques of selling pensions, it also has the systems...and the administration. We on the other hand are good at our particular core areas of investment management...we think that's a very good marriage,"" Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Hermes, said. Ross Goobey said Hermes had approached Liberty International only to find the group had been considering an approach to Hermes. ""It really was a meeting of minds on this. Whether it develops further from this we shall see. I think one step at a time is quite enough for us."" He said the venture would probably not be up and running until the first quarter of next year as regulatory approval first had to be obtained for the new group. The decision by the giant British Telecom Pension Scheme to transfer assets to the new Hermes Liberty International Pensions funds would give the new venture a boost. ""I would hope it gives some people some feeling of security that BT Pension Scheme, which is after all the biggest in the country, is willing to do this,"" he said. Liberty plans to sell personal pensions at its regional shopping centres, which are held through a majority-owned subsidiary Capital Shopping Centres. These have more than 150 million customer visits a year, Liberty said. Fischel said an announcement would be made on exactly how the retail customer business would work at a future date, adding he could not give details at present. ($1=.6395 Pound) ",AlexanderSmith
"A high-profile purge at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell of any managers found to bear responsibility for failing to spot irregular dealings by former fund manager Peter Young is expected next week, banking sources said on Friday. The investment banking arm of Deutsche Bank is due to complete a preliminary report with accountants Ernst &amp; Young into what went wrong internally and led to the suspension of three Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM) funds last month and Young's dismissal for alleged ""gross misconduct"". Trading in the three funds, which totalled around 1.4 billion pounds ($2.21 billion) and were held by around 90,000 retail investors, was temporarily suspended early in September but resumed after Deutsche stepped in with a 180 million pounds cash injection. Young, who has had his assets frozen and his passport impounded, is currently under investigation by Britain's Serious Fraud Office, which probes major financial crime. He has said he was not guilty of any criminal activity and is being made a scapegoat for failings. A probe into his management of two of the funds in question, which held too high a proportion of unlisted, speculative stocks has been underway since problems emerged. Both MGAM and investments watchdog the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (IMRO) have undertaken their own inquiries with forensic accountants carrying out a detailed dissection of trading history of the funds. IMRO's own investigation, which could lead to hefty punishments against the firm, will take longer to conclude. There have been conflicting reports over what the ramifications of any sackings following the debacle would be. As head of the asset management arm Keith Percy's position will inevitably be under review but some British newspapers have suggested key MGAM clients are opposing any action against him while others are said to be threatening to withdraw assets if he stays. A similar quandary is reported to be exercising the minds of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell (DMG) officials in London and the Deutsche Bank hierarchy in Frankfurt. Other key managers, including Glyn Owen, MGAM's chief European investment officer and Mike Wheatley, compliance director for the fund management business are also likely to face scrutiny because of their executive responsibilities. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said it could not comment on speculative newspaper reports, but the group said when problems first surfaced that it would produce a preliminary report within six weeks. ""We can't comment on any such speculation and we have always pointed out that we would announce potential management decisions after the internal investigation has been finalised,"" a DMG spokesman in London told Reuters. From the beginning Deutsche has made it clear that it would take any action deemed necessary to restore confidence in its fund management business and if lapses in internal controls were found, heads would roll. But despite difficult decisions emerging in the intervening weeks, Deutsche's resolve to give its fund management arm and by association its investment banking operation a clean bill of health, has not faltered, banking sources said.

"Shares in Cable &amp; Wireless (C&amp;W) advanced on Tuesday after investors welcomed news of a deal with NYNEX of the United States and Bell Canada International to create Britain's largest cable operator. ""This was a bold strategic stroke by the (C&amp;W) chief executive,"" said Chris McFadden, analyst at Merrill Lynch. The deal, which took only five weeks to complete, brings together C&amp;W's Mercury, British cable company Videotron, Bell Cablemedia and NYNEX CableComms, eclipsing Telewest as Britain's biggest cable operator. It sent C&amp;W shares soaring, peaking at 476.5 pence before easing back to close up 25.5 at 466.5 pence. The move is a landmark deal for C&amp;W chief executive Richard Brown, appointed five months ago, and follows the collapse of merger talks earlier this year between C&amp;W and its great rival British Telecommunications Plc. ""The logic is irrefutable...the advantages of scope and size are undoubtedly there,"" said Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull analyst John Tysoe. BT said it welcomed the consolidation in the sector and analysts said the move could strengthen the telecoms giant's calls for it to be allowed to provide cable television. But BT's shares edged lower to close down 4.5 at 353.5 pence and analysts said the new company would give BT a run for its money. ""We had a common vision of what could be done and we have done it with speed and nimbleness,"" Brown told Reuters. C&amp;W last month replaced BT in a major German alliance with diversified utility RWE that is seen as the main competitor to Deutsche Telekom's dominance as the German market is liberalised. The new merged company, which will provide integrated telecommunications, information and entertainment services, will give C&amp;W's telephone company Mercury access to 18 million business and domestic customers, Brown said. The number of homes within its sights will eclipse former market leader Telewest's two million at 2.47 million but it will not be in direct competition as the companies operate in different franchises. Telewest's shares were boosted by the news, as analysts re-evaluated the potential in the sector, gaining 12.5 pence to close at 135.5 pence. ""This is clear evidence of confidence in the future of the U.K. cable industry,"" a spokesman for industry body the Cable Communications Association, said. Around six billion pounds ($7.5 billion) has already been invested in laying out cable networks and a further six billion pounds of investment is planned, the spokesman added. In a related deal, Videotron is being bought by Bell Cablemedia in a complex transaction involving a $338 million equity investment in Bell Cablemedia by Cable &amp; Wireless. This values Videotron at around $1.09 billion. Once the merger and Videotron deal have been completed, Cable &amp; Wireless will own 52.6 percent of the new company -- to be called Cable &amp; Wireless Communications -- with NYNEX owning 18.5 percent and Bell Canada 14.2 percent. The remaining 15 percent will be floated, which analysts said would give it some scarcity value, with listings planned in both London and New York, probably in about six months. C&amp;W's Brown said he could not detail the financial aspects of the merger because of the new company's planned listing. McFadden said cost savings should be quite significant, including tax offsets, refinancing of high-yield cable television funding and possibly through staff cuts, along with eliminating duplication in laying cables. The new group aims to increase revenues by providing a wider range of services to existing customers, offering a combination of telecoms, broadband, data transmission, video shopping and Internet access. It could also secure more favourable terms for programming from BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp has a 40 percent stake. BSkyB shares ended down 18 pence at 678.5 pence. ($1=.7986 Pound) ",AlexanderSmith
"Cable and telecoms giants Cable &amp; Wireless, NYNEX Corp of the U.S. and Bell Canada International on Tuesday announced the formation of a major new British cable player by merging the operations of their British subsidiaries.

In a related deal, Videotron is being bought by Bell Cablemedia in a complex deal which involves a $338 million equity investment in Bell Cablemedia by Cable &amp; Wireless and values Videotron at around $1.09 billion.

"Britain's largest home loan lender, Halifax Building Society, said on Thursday it was confident of avoiding any takeover attempt when it floats on the stock market and sheds mutuality for bank status next June. ""We think we can stand on our own feet,"" David Gilchrist, Halifax's director of corporate affairs said. The society, currently owned by its savers and borrowers, gave details of the timetable for conversion and flotation, which analysts have said could be worth 10 billion pounds ($16 billion). The building society's nine million members will vote early next year on the conversion, which it is billing as the largest single extension of private share ownership in Britain. Gilchrist said a decision to transfer its business to an existing subsidiary rather than to a company specially formed for conversion meant it would lose five-year protection against takeover but underlined its confidence. Analysts said the consolidation of Britain's financial services market is likely to continue, which could make the large and successful Halifax a possible target. The flotation will project the society into the top 25 companies in London's blue chip FTSE 100 stock index and Gilchrist said he was confident that shareholders would be convinced by its past performance to reject any bid attempt. The concersion method raises the voting threshold needed for the plans to go ahead, but Gilchrist said he believed the necessary 50 percent of investing members entitled to vote would be met. ""We have no real concerns as far as the voting is concerned,"" he said, adding that previous building society conversions achieved approvals of over 75 percent. ""It will be a high-profile exercise, backed up by plenty of marketing,"" Gilchrist said. But members eagerly expecting to find out how big a windfall they are likely to receive when they receive free shares will have to wait until January before getting any indication. The Halifax said its members would be given full details of the conversion plans and share distribution scheme. This will tell them the number of shares they are entitled to and indicate their likely price range, based on prevailing market conditions. Gilchrist said members would get a ""broad idea"" at this time, but would not be drawn on what the share hand-out was likely to be worth to the average investor. He also declined to comment on the cost of the conversion exercise. But it seems likely to provide a boon to Britain's postal service and the printing industry as well as the financial and legal advisors working on the plans. ""The major element of cost is printing and mailing. We will be sending 75 million items of mail,"" he said. Halifax members will be urged to vote ""as quickly as possible"" on the proposals and a special general meeting will be held in February. If members vote in favour, they will be sent details of share allocations in April or May. Gilchrist said the Halifax had not yet done any market research on how many members would sell or retain shares. ""We are not trying to persuade people one way or another whether to hold shares or to sell the shares,"" he said, adding the Halifax would sound out members nearer the time. The society will remind its members that they should have at least 100 pounds in total in their accounts on December 31 1996. If eligible for a variable distribution of extra free shares they ""may need to top up their share accounts to the November 25 1994 level by the date of the special general meeting"" to qualify for the maximum number of free shares, the Halifax said.

""It will be a high-profile exercise, backed up by plenty of marketing,"" Gilchrist said.

This will tell them the number of shares they are entitled to receive and an indication of their likely price range, based on prevailing market conditions at the time. Gilchrist said members would get a ""broad idea"" at this time, but would not be drawn on what the share hand-out was likely to be worth to the average investor.   He also declined to comment on what the cost of the conversion exercise would be, saying only that a significant element would be printing and postage costs. ""The major element of cost is printing and mailing. We will be sending 75 million items of mail,"" he said. Halifax members will be urged to vote ""as quickly as possible"" on the proposals and a special general meeting will be held in Sheffield in February. If members vote in favour, they will be sent details of share allocations in April or May. Gilchrist said the Halifax had not yet done any market research on how many members would sell or retain shares.   ""We are not trying to persuade people one way or another whether to hold shares or to sell the shares,"" he said, adding the Halifax would sound out members nearer the time. But it was working on the basis that a ""large number"" would have already planned to spend their windfall and had set up a share dealing system to ensure an orderly market for what will be the largest single extension of private share ownership ever in Britain, Gilchrist added. Those who decide to sell will be offered a free-of-charge postal service for a limited period while those who keep them can chose between placing them in a nominee company or receiving a share certificate. The Halifax favours the nominee option. The society will remind its members that they should have at least 100 stg in total in their accounts on December 31 1996. If eligible for a variable distribution of extra free shares they ""may need to top up their share accounts to the November 25 1994 level by the date of the special general meeting"" to qualify for the maximum number of free shares, the Halifax said. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717 ",AlexanderSmith
"The ""Big Bang"" maintained London as one of the world's financial hubs, but 10 years on the role of specialised financial ""boutiques"" at the heart of the City is under mounting pressure from huge integrated investment banks. ""The wonderful time that there has been for the small boutique since Big Bang is over. The days of the single violinist are past, it's time for the full orchestra,"" one banking source told Reuters. The so-called Big Bang of 1986 brought about radical reforms in the way the London Stock Exchange and the British government bond market operated, principally by allowing mergers between merchant banks, brokers and stock jobbers. It saw the demise of traditional names such as Wedd Durlacher Mordaunt and Phillips and Drew which became parts of Barclays' investment bank BZW and of UBS respectively. And ever since the initial wave of changes investment banking giants with global aspirations have been hoovering up small players which have carved out a niche for themselves. U.S. EXPERIENCE SETS THE PACE In the world of corporate finance this pattern of smaller firms being swallowed up by the large players is set to mirror what has taken place in the U.S., corporate financiers say. ""I believe the world is moving away from small nimble-footed boutiques, which had a wonderful time under the Conservative government. The new world is going to be based around very big cross-border corporate finance. You need a very big broking arm behind you,"" one corporate financier said. This need for broking capacity and a dwindling number of independent brokers, combined with increasing regulatory demands for capital, has shrunk the opportunities for boutiques. Even in the growing derivatives market, the amounts of capital needed to play the global markets mean small outfits are hard to sustain. BOUTIQUES THREATENED BY EUROPE INTEGRATION Apart from the possibility of an opposition Labour government and perhaps greater restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, with the need for companies to prove that a takeover is in the public interest, the other threat to corporate finance boutiques comes from European integration. Increased bureaucracy and more rigorous European Commission demands on the companies involved in takeovers will mean even greater research capabilities and legal back-up are required by the financiers advising companies on such deals, bankers say. ""Boutiques won't be much good if you have got to take a huge team of analysts and brokers out to Brussels every time you are planning a deal,"" said one. With U.S. investment banking mammoths such as Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch building increasing roles in corporate finance as well as their traditional broking and trading strengths, this is also putting pressure on the small corporate finance players. HAMBRO MAGAN FALLS TO NATIONAL WESTMINSTER A recent casualty is J Hambro Magan, which two weeks ago was sold to NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of Britain's National Westminster Bank, for an estimated 80 million pounds ($127.3 million). The prominent corporate finance boutique was set up by George Magan in 1988 and has been involved in some of the biggest mergers and acquisitions in Britain in recent years. ""The new world is going to be dominated by the very big boys,"" another banker said. Some commentators say the future of small boutiques is not as bleak as it may appear. They see the demise of some as merely part of a cycle which will spawn new dynamic teams based around talented individuals who may decide to leave a large established firm, take clients and expertise with them, and go it alone. ""It's an on-going process. It's always postulated every time there's a rash of takeovers that boutiques are going out of fashion. But it's the same process as Big Bang. Small firms have developed since. Some have disappeared and been replaced by others,"" a banking analyst at one U.S. investment bank said. In cases such as Hambro Magan, the cycle has turned full circle, with the key individuals making significant financial gains for themselves by selling a highly successful business at its peak and coming back into the folds of a larger player. SMALL FIRMS CAN SELL PERSONALISED SERVICE But while small firms will never compete for the truly global roles, there is still a place for the personalised localised service offered by boutiques. ""There's always a demand for that type of service,"" he added. Others agree that in a world where investment banks are attempting to become so-called ""one-stop shops"", the pressures to sell clients an entire package of products could in fact enhance the position of boutiques, whose advice is perhaps more truly independent as they don't have other axes to grind. DRESDNER KLEINWORT BUYS LUTHY BAILLIE Another boutique to have fallen prey to a multi-national banking player with plenty of capital behind it, sophisticated trading and broking operations and global ambitions is the bond specialist Luthy Baillie Dowsett Pethick &amp; Co. It was snapped up only two weeks ago by Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, the investment banking division of Germany's second largest commercial bank Dresdner Bank. Peter Luthy, one of the founders of the 15-person bond boutique which was set up in 1990, said the firm's reliance on a market undergoing significant changes because of the interest rate environment and the constraints of size had forced it to seek embrace of a larger partner. ""We learned a hell of a lot. But our business skills are better used in a big firm. The opportunities are better in a big firm,"" Luthy told Reuters recently. Such changes will not necessarily end with the small firms such as Luthy's. Banking analysts and corporate financiers alike have for some time been predicting the days are numbered for what one called the ""super-boutiques"". This dwindling list of traditional British merchant banks includes Cazenoves, NM Rothschilds, Hambros, Schroders and Robert Fleming. Takeovers here are complicated in some cases by family holdings, but strategic alliances have been suggested as an acceptable alternative in order to compete globally. ""I think even the super-boutiques are going to be struggling over the next five years,"" the first banking source said. ($1=.6285 Pound) ",AlexanderSmith
"Lloyd's insurance market on Tuesday welcomed a crucial U.S. district court ruling in its favour and said it would extend a deadline for acceptances of a 3.2 billion pound ($5.5 billion) recovery plan. ""We have decided in the circumstances we will keep the offer open,"" Lloyd's chairman David Rowland said after a district court in Baltimore, Maryland, overturned an injunction by U.S. Names -- as investors in the market are known -- who were unhappy with the plan. Rowland did not say how long the deadline would be extended from noon (1100 GMT) on Wednesday, but insurance sources said it would probably be stretched for several days to allow more U.S. Names to approve the plan. A Lloyd's spokesman said the ruling had removed the last major legal obstacle to the 300-year-old insurance market's recovery plan, aimed at ending years of turbulence triggered by huge liabilities. Lloyd's earlier said more than 82 percent of its 34,000 worldwide members had approved the plan, but only 53 percent of the 2,700 U.S. names had given the go-ahead. ""Since we won the appeal, faxes have been flooding in from U.S. Names accepting the settlement offer,"" a Lloyd's spokesman said by telephone. Lloyd's hopes the support shown by Names will be enough to declare the plan unconditional when its ruling council meets on Thursday. The plan still has to be approved by the Department of Trade and Industry. Lloyd's problems began in the 1980s when a fatal combination of negligent underwriting, poor investment advice and a sequence of unexpected natural disasters conspired to bring about losses of several billion pounds. Long standing Names were for the first time in their lives suddenly faced with the prospect of unlimited losses. A spokesman for one of the three key litigating British action groups representing major loss-making Names described the successful appeal as ""very good"" for the recovery plan. ""I think we did better by the settlement than by going through the courts,"" said the spokesman for the Merrett 418 Names Association, which groups 1,932 members. Under the proposals, Lloyd's will reinsure its massive liabilities in a new company called Equitas. It is asking investors to help fund Equitas but has offered them a compensation package to help offset their losses. Rowland said he was delighted by the U.S. ruling, which overturned a injunction granted by a lower court to a group of U.S. Names who wanted more time to study the terms of the settlement. ""I am very pleased. I have believed for a long time that what we are doing is in the interest of the whole society,"" Rowland told Reuters, adding he did not want to exclude anyone from the offer. Many of the market's pre-1993 liabilities stem from pollution and asbestosis related claims in the United States, some of them dating back even to the last century. ",AlexanderSmith
"Britain's Invesco Plc Monday agreed to merge with Houston-based mutual fund company AIM Management Group Inc. in a deal valued at $1.6 billion, creating one of the world's largest investment management businesses. The deal is the largest in U.S. fund history, industry experts said. The combined group will be called Amvesco Plc and have around $150 billion under management. The merger will be paid for with about $1.1 billion in new stock and the rest in cash and debt, Invesco officials said. ""We are creating a prototype company for the future,"" Bob McCullough, Invesco's chief financial officer, said in an interview. Invesco Chairman Charles Brady, who will lead the combined group, said it would have ""the scale necessary for success as a financially strong and independent business operating in an increasingly concentrated industry."" McCullough stressed the deal was a merger of the two companies, which would focus on growing revenue but retain their individual identities. ""They're buying themselves into the U.S. money management market,"" said Bruce Brewington, an equity analyst at Putnam, Lovell &amp; Thorton, an investment banking firm in San Francisco. Martin Cross, analyst at UBS, said Invesco is buying at the top of the Wall Street market, which many experts see as overpriced. He said UBS strategists are forecasting a 15 percent downward correction in the Dow Jones industrial average next year, and if it occurs, it would leave AIM looking rather expensive. ""The deal is exquisitely timed for the AIM shareholders and conversely not so exquisitely for Invesco shareholders,"" Cross said. Invesco said it would fund the deal by issuing 290 million new shares to AIM shareholders. These would be valued at about $1.1 billion. AIM shareholders will own around 45 percent of the merged company. McCullough said another $500 million needed to fund the merger would come in the form of cash and debt. The merger presented a chance for the two companies to use different distribution channels and approaches. McCullough said he did not forsee any culture clash between the two. There would be no change in their differing approaches, with Invesco continuing to be a ""no-load"" house, selling products direct to the customer, and AIM selling its nearly three dozen funds through brokers. McCullough said the cost of the merger was not excessive. ""There's no question that it is a lot of money, but we view this as a long-term investment for both of us,"" he said. The long-term commitment was underlined by the fact that almost 50 percent of the combined shares would be held by management. Both companies were ""really active managers"" and would stay that way rather than moving to passive management, McCullough said, adding that Invesco's global infrastructure presented a major opportunity. He denied the heavy exposure to the United States would hinder Invesco from making the most of opportunities in other parts of the world. ""We would like nothing better than to find opportunities in Asia and Europe,"" he said. The merger would enhance the group's strength in the United States and lead to cost savings, officials said. McCullough said the merger must be approved by Invesco and AIM shareholders and other approvals were required. The deal should be completed early next year, the company said. ",AlexanderSmith
"British fund manager Invesco announced its widely-expected merger with U.S. mutual fund company AIM Management Group on Monday, creating one of the world's largest investment management businesses. The combined group will be called AMVESCO Plc and have around $150 billion under management. The merger values AIM at approximately $1.6 billion, Invesco said.. ""We are creating a prototype company for the future,"" Bob McCullough, Invesco's chief financial officer, told Reuters. But analysts were divided as to the timing of the deal although most were happy to give Invesco the benefit of the doubt as far as its claims on synergy are concerned. ""The deal is exquisitely timed for the AIM shareholders and conversely not so exquisitely for Invesco shareholders,"" said Martin Cross, analyst at UBS. Cross argues that Invesco is buying at the top of the Wall Street market which many see as having some very stretched valuations. Cross said that UBS strategists are forecasting a 15 percent downward correction on the Dow Jones index next year which, if it came to pass, would leave AIM looking rather expensive. But Phillip Gibbs at BZW was upbeat about the merger. ""It looks rather cheap, I think they've done rather nicely,"" Gibbs said but did add a rider on the possibility of a major correction in the US equities market. Analysts said the price paid by Invesco was something short of what had been predicted but Cross said it was a ""pretty full price but what one might expect for a premium company."" Invesco shares closed unchanged at 237.5p Invesco's chairman and chief executive Charles Brady, the man who will lead the new group, said it would have ""the scale necessary for success as a financially strong and independent business operating in an increasingly concentrated industry."" Invesco said it would fund the merger with the issue of 290 million new shares to existing holders of AIM shares. These would be valued at approximately $1.1 billion. AIM shareholders will own around 45 percent of the enlarged group and be subject to restrictions on selling the shares. McCullough said the merger, which is conditional on approval by both Invesco and AIM shareholders and other approvals, would be non-dilutive and would not have any cost savings built-in. However, there would be cost savings in the future, he said. The merger is not expected to be completed before February. McCullough also said the $500 million needed to fund the merger would come in the form of cash and debt, with a one-for-five rights offering on the cards. This would involve issuing roughly 50 million new shares, he said. McCullough said the cost of the merger was not excessive. ""If you look at it on the basis of funds under management, it (the cost) is less than three percent,"" he said. ""There's no question that it is a lot of money, but we view this as a long-term investment for both of us,"" he said.

"British property company Greycoat Plc, under fire from a group of shareholders calling for it to be broken up, said on Monday it was confident of getting the support of its institutional shareholders in rejecting the plan. ""I would be very surprised if they (Greycoat's institutional shareholders) would come down on the side of a closing down sale,"" Greycoat's chief executive Peter Thornton told Reuters. Thornton said he believed the liquidation proposal by the UK Active Value Fund, which will be put to shareholders in 10-days time, was ""ill-conceived and fails to secure shareholder value"".   Earlier Greycoat wrote to its shareholders urging them to reject the resolution, put forward by rebel shareholder Brian Myerson, at an extraordinary general meeting on November 14. Myerson's Active Value Advisors Ltd (AVA) advises the UK Active Value Fund and is expected to put out its own response to the statement later today. Last month Myerson said it was time to ""unlock the value of Greycoat"" as the company's shares stood at a 23 percent discount to the forecast net asset value for 1997. He said there was ""considerable support"" for the proposal to dispose of Greycoat's assets and enhance shareholder value.   Greycoat, which focuses on central London office developments, earlier announced a rise in interim pre-tax profits to 3.8 million stg and predicted a final dividend of 1.2 pence per share. Thornton said the results showed the company was having a very good year, adding it was well placed to take advantage of favourable investor sentiment on the central London property market. ""The whole market is moving in our direction,"" he said. The share discount to net asset value had been worsened by the fact that UKAV held 10 percent of the shares and this was overhanging the market, he added.   Martin Poole, Greycoat's finance director, said the company had got its long-term debt in place, adding that its lender banks were not in any way ruffled by the current uncertainty. ""The novelty has worn off from the bank's point of view,"" Poole told Reuters. To get rid of the bank debt, which would be required by any liquidation plans, would cost ""roughly 10 million stg"", he added. Poole said he expected good growth in the dividend in the medium term, in line with the group's policy of progressively increasing it. ""There is no reason why we shouldn't continue at the higher rate of profit,"" he said.   While Greycoat does not intend to use further resources on development sites, it is likely to use the cash generated by the sale of its Buckingham Palace Road property for investment. Thornton said discussions were already underway with several parties, but he stressed the company would not pay over the odds, would not compromise on what it wanted and would not buy anything in the market. Rather than concentrating on a single asset, there would be two or three purchases or ""possibly more"". Greycoat had around 50 million stg to spend and this would be geared up to around 50 million stg cash and the same amount of debt, Thornton added. -- London Newsroom ++ 44 171 542 7719 ",AlexanderSmith
"KPMG, one of the world's big six international accounting and consultancy firms, believes investment in infrastructure and technology has put it on track to hasten revenue growth. ""We would like to be growing faster and are committed to growing faster,"" Jon Madonna, chairman of KPMG International told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday. Earlier the group reported an eight percent rise in worldwide revenues for the fiscal year to September 30, 1996 to $8.1 billion, up from $7.5 billion the year before. Madonna, who earlier this year said revenue growth in excess of 10 percent was a reasonable expectation, said KPMG had invested heavily in infrastructure and technology during the year and this would pay off in terms of further growth. He said all sides of the business had performed well over the year but stressed that significant growth in revenues was likely to come from the consulting side of the business rather than from the traditional backbone of auditing and tax. ""If you look at where the great opportunity is, its on the consulting side,"" Madonna said. While KPMG's growth rate for the year was lower than rival firm Andersen Worldwide, which last month reported a 16 percent increase in 1996 revenues to $9.4 billion, Madonna said he was not disappointed with the firm's result. When looked at on a dollar-adjusted basis, the 1996 revenue growth was the same as for the previous year, Madonna said. But there was still work to be done. ""I said a year ago we need to be growing faster. I just think we have got to do a lot better than that. It's a big ship and you don't turn it around in just a few days,"" he added. The investment and strategic moves KPMG had made had ensured it would be in a strong position for the future. ""The road we are on is the right road"". Madonna said the firm's partners were agreed that the moves it had made over the year were correct and the fact that everybody wanted faster growth confirmed the need for large-scale investments. ""We are making sizeable dollar investments in terms of infrastructure and product development."" This included around $500 million a year on technology and ""well in excess"" of $100 million on products. For Madonna the key is what the partnership, which employs more than 77,000 people and has more than 6,250 partners, is doing in three years' time. The strategy which KPMG has embarked on will not be altered to achieve further revenue growth and areas such as developing new products and establishing a framework of common industries and a common infrastructure across the firm's worldwide business will continue. Madonna, who believes there will be further consolidation among the big accountancy firms, said KPMG will also stick to growing from within rather than through large-scale acquisition. The number of major accounting firms in the world has dropped from eight in the mid-1980s to six, with a rise in competition from other types of firms. But Madonna does not see KPMG making any big buys. ""There will be local acquisitions and mergers down the road but I don't think anything big is on the horizon."" ",AlexanderSmith
"Top managers in major financial firms need to be razor-sharp if the world's increasingly complex markets are to run smoothly, however sophisticated the regulatory regime, regulators and politicians said on Thursday. ""Management needs to know its business. (It) sets the ethos of the company,"" Alistair Darling, spokesman on treasury affairs for Britain's opposition Labour party told a conference on financial regulation and minimising systemic risk. Examples of where rules had been broken by so-called ""rogue traders"" were a clear sign of management failure, he said. Christine Cumming, senior vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, also voiced doubts about management's current ability to deal with regulatory problems. The health of an institution lay in its management and directors, but they were not necessarily properly armed to deal with problems when they arose, she said. ""Do we prepare directors and managers enough?"" Cumming said. Britain's often criticised regulatory system, which relies heavily on so-called ""self-regulation,"" is also under scrutiny. Darling said that whichever party won the next general election, due by May 1997, the British regulatory system ""will be reformed."" But this would not mean ""tearing everything up or dramatic change,"" he added. He said Labour wanted to establish a regulator with sufficient ""clout reputation and stature"" to deal with its international counterparts. But it would not create a ""Super-SIB,"" an enlarged version of the top regulator the Securities and Investments Board (SIB), as some commentators have suggested. A Labour government would also attempt to limit the number of regulations. Darling's call for minimising the regulatory burden by making it as cost-effective as possible was echoed by most of the speakers at the conference. Angela Knight, Britain's economic secretary to the Treasury, said the government wants to see a cost-benefit analysis applied to all regulations. If they fail to make sense on this basis then they should not be adopted, she said. Knight also underlined the dramatic effect on the industry as a whole of the collapse of blue-blooded merchant bank Barings in February 1995 was ""a more salutory lesson than any regulation"" to other banks and financial institutions. There were calls from both politicians for interchange between industry and the regulators, so that the experiences on either side of the fence could be carried across by individuals. But while the idea of the regulators being staffed by people with first-hand industry knowledge won support from many of those attending the meeting, the question of how the pay structure could accomodate such movements was seen by some as a serious obstacle to this system spreading. And while regulators need to keep up with rapid changes in financial instruments and the industry landscape both on a domestic and a global scale, they can never be expected to be one step ahead of the business they are monitoring. ""Regulators should respond to business realities rather than be ahead of business trends,"" Sir Andrew Large, chairman of the SIB told the meeting. This would mean regulators becoming increasingly sophisticated to cope with the changing business environment and having to co-operate more and more with their counterparts in other countries. ""The next generation of supervisors will have to evaluate far more complex information and make far more complex judgements,"" Large said. ",AlexanderSmith
"British property company Greycoat is unlikely to crumble under pressure from rebel shareholders who want it broken up or succumb to a merger approach from smaller rival Moorfield Estates, analysts said on Monday. ""I don't think they are on the critical list in any sense or meaning of the word,"" one analyst said. A proposal to sell-off Greycoat's assets is due to be put to shareholders at a special meeting on Thursday. It has been put forward by the UK Active Value Fund, which is advised by rebel shareholder Brian Myerson's Active Value Advisers. UK Active Value Fund bought its 11 percent stake in Greycoat three years ago, rescuing it from receivership. But Myerson's relationship with the firm's management has not run smoothly. The South African financier's challenge to the Greycoat management has also triggered a proposal by Moorfield Estates involving a share exchange offer for the larger Greycoat, which has so far dismissed the approach. Moorfield said in a statement on Monday that it had ""developed a proposal to add value for all shareholders through a strategy of more active management of the assets of Greycoat"". It said this had been presented to some of Greycoat's larger shareholders, accounting for close to 40 percent of the shares, and an approach had then been made to Greycoat's chairman. They include merging the two companies by a share exchange and restructuring the assets of the enlarged group. This would involve a Central London portfolio made up initially of Greycoat's main assets, Embankment Place and 123 Buckingham Palace Road, which would later be demerged. Moorfield also intends setting up a portfolio of ""investment and development property earmarked for immediate disposal to a major property company"". The remainder of the enlarged group would constitute ""an investment, trading and development portfolio"" and there would be a reorganisation of the management structure to reduce costs by ""at least 1.5 million pounds ($2.47 million) per annum"", Moorfield said. While analysts agreed the Moorfield plan was unlikely to succeed, some said there was an opportunity for Greycoat to take over another company with higher profitability so the combined company could capitalise on Greycoat's favourable tax position. ""But they are not going to be flushed out by Thursday,"" a second property analyst told Reuters, adding that three or four companies had looked ""very seriously"" at the possibility of joining with Greycoat. Another possibility would be a larger group such as British Land sweeping up Greycoat, although such an outcome seems remote in the short-term, analysts said. Myerson's proposed sale of Greycoat's London property assets is seen by some as an unwise ""forced sale"" which would not achieve shareholder value in what is an improving market. ""Generally speaking a forced sale of their assets would not gain anything in the short term,"" the first analyst said, adding that with rental growth starting to show through, it made sense to hold onto Greycoat's two largest properties. ""They are vulnerable to any change in market conditions, but it would be a mistake to be forced into a corner and to sell something in a relatively short timescale. It would be totally counterproductive,"" he added. But others said the time was right to sell off Greycoat's largest assets. ""This is exactly the right time of the cycle (to sell,"" the second analyst said. Greycoat shares closed 6.5 pence higher at 155.5 pence while Moorfield shares were unchanged at 30.5 pence.

"Final approval for Lloyd's of London's recovery plan edged closer on Wednesday as it declared that over 90 percent of members had accepted a settlement offer aimed at securing the 300-year-old insurance market's future. Lloyd's said it had been swamped by U.S. investors signing up for its recovery plan after a U.S. appeals court overturned a ruling that had threatened the insurance market's survival. By Wednesday afternoon 66.7 percent of U.S. members had accepted. ""The level of acceptances speaks for itself. Members have made their views toward the reconstruction of Lloyd's abundantly clear,"" Lloyd's chairman David Rowland said in a statement. Earlier a Lloyd's spokesman said acceptances from U.S. Names, investors in the market, had flooded in overnight. Almost half of the 2,700 U.S. Names had until last night held off. Only 53 percent had accepted by Tuesday. This followed a Baltimore appeal court's decision late on Tuesday to overturn U.S. judge Robert Payne's ruling last Friday to allow U.S. Names more time to consider the plan. Payne granted an injunction giving U.S. Names more time to consider the plan and ordered Lloyd's to provide further information by September 23. On Tuesday a panel of judges in Baltimore sent the case back to the Virginia district court with orders to dismiss it. Rowland said he acknowledged many overseas members had deferred their acceptance in the light of the Virginia court judgement and the subsequent Baltimore ruling. Over the last few days, evidence of support for the Lloyd's proposals among its 34,000 investors worldwide has grown. On Tuesday evening acceptances totalled 82 percent, compared to only 75 percent on Saturday. Wednesday's noon deadline for accepting the recovery plan, under which Lloyd's proposes Names pay to help reinsure billions of pounds in liabilities into a new company called Equitas, was extended to give all a chance to respond. Rowland said on Wednesday afternoon that in the circumstances it was ""fair and proper"" to exercise flexibility in pushing back the deadline for acceptances. Lloyd's said that any formal, longer-term extension would be subject to a decision by its council at a Thursday meeting at which it would consider ""the prospect of declaring the settlement offer acceptances unconditional."" This extension will crucially allow the market enough time to collect the convincing majority of acceptances, especially from U.S. Names, which it needs to prove its own solvency. Lloyd's problems began in the 1980s when a destructive combination of negligent underwriting, poor investment advice and a sequence of natural disasters conspired to bring about losses of several billion pounds. Long-standing Names were for the first time in their lives suddenly faced with the prospect of unlimited losses. The market is due to submit figures to Britain's Department of Trade and Industry next week in an annual solvency test, and file with the U.S. Treasury and New York Insurance Department later next month. Equitas may lift off in two weeks if all goes as planned. The recovery plan's success increasingly looks likely, but another challenge by U.S. Names has not been ruled out. However, U.S. legal sources said overnight that, while U.S. investors could in theory attempt to challenge Tuesday's order it would be difficult to do so successfully. Despite that, one U.S. Name and chief negotiator for an action group known as the American Names Association, Kenneth Chiate, said he expected U.S. Names to appeal the Baltimore ruling.

"Final approval for Lloyd's of London's recovery plan edged closer Wednesday as it declared that over 90 percent of members had accepted a settlement offer aimed at securing the 300-year-old insurance market's future. Lloyd's said it had been swamped by U.S. investors signing up for its recovery plan after a U.S. appeals court overturned a ruling that had threatened the insurance market's survival. By Wednesday afternoon, 66.7 percent of U.S. members had accepted. ""The level of acceptances speaks for itself. Members have made their views toward the reconstruction of Lloyd's abundantly clear,"" Lloyd's Chairman David Rowland said in a statement. Earlier, a Lloyd's spokesman said acceptances from U.S. investors in the market, known as Names, had flooded in overnight. Almost half of the 2,700 U.S. Names had until Tuesday night held off, with only 53 percent accepting by then. This followed a decision by a federal appeals court in Baltimore Tuesday to overturn U.S. District Court Judge Robert Payne's ruling in Richmond, Va., Friday to allow U.S. Names more time to consider the plan. Payne granted an injunction giving U.S. Names more time to consider the plan and ordered Lloyd's to provide further information by Sept. 23. On Tuesday, the panel of judges in Baltimore sent the case back to the lower court with orders to dismiss it. Rowland said he acknowledged that many overseas members had deferred their acceptance in the light of the Virginia court judgment and the subsequent Baltimore ruling. Over the last few days, evidence of support for the Lloyd's proposals among its 34,000 investors worldwide has grown. On Tuesday evening, acceptances totalled 82 percent, compared with 75 percent Saturday. Wednesday's noon deadline for accepting the 3.2 billion pounds ($4.7 billion) recovery plan, under which Lloyd's proposes that Names pay to help reinsure billions of pounds in liabilities into a new company called Equitas, was extended to give all a chance to respond. Rowland said Wednesday afternoon that under the circumstances it was ""fair and proper"" to exercise flexibility in pushing back the deadline for acceptances. Lloyd's said that any formal, longer-term extension would be subject to a decision by its council at a Thursday meeting at which it would consider ""the prospect of declaring the settlement offer acceptances unconditional."" This extension will give the market enough time to collect the convincing majority of acceptances, especially from U.S. Names, which it needs to prove its own solvency. Lloyd's problems began in the 1980s when a destructive combination of negligent underwriting, poor investment advice and a sequence of natural disasters conspired to bring about losses of several billion pounds. Long-standing Names were for the first time in their lives suddenly faced with the prospect of unlimited losses. The market is due to submit figures to Britain's Department of Trade and Industry next week in an annual solvency test, and file with the U.S. Treasury and New York Insurance Department later next month. Equitas may lift off in two weeks if all goes as planned. The recovery plan's success increasingly looks likely, but another challenge by U.S. Names has not been ruled out.

"British merchant bank Hambros, under fire from a rebel Hong Kong shareholder calling for its breakup, reported a return to first-half profit on Wednesday and said the benefits of restructuring should begin to show through. ""We have great confidence in ourselves and what we are trying to do,"" Sir Chips Keswick, the group's chief executive, said in an interview. He dismissed efforts by Hong Kong investment manager Regent Pacific Group, which holds three percent of Hambros, to break up the firm in an attempt to realise shareholder value. ""Regent is a three percent shareholder and is perfectly entitled to (its) views. We are perfectly entitled not to share them,"" Keswick said. Hambros reported pretax profits of 35.0 million pounds ($57.81 million) for the first half, compared with a 7.7 million pound loss for the same period in 1995. Some analysts had forecast pretax profits of up to 45.0 million pounds based on a strong performance by Hambros' estate agent subsidiary Hambro Countrywide. They also predicted an interim dividend range of between 2.5 and 3.0 pence. In the event the dividend was unchanged at 2.5 pence. Hambros is among a dwindling list of British investment banks which are the constant subject of takeover speculation. However, it has been seen as one of the less attractive targets due to recent poor performance and major provisions for bad debts. Bad debt provisions for the period were 5.9 million pounds compared with 23.5 million in the same period in 1995. Asked about the possibility of Hambros becomin a takeover target for a larger international player, Keswick said a public company was always in the firing line but he was happy with the group's direction. While he could not talk for shareholders in the group, Keswick said he had the impression from discussions with them in the wake of the Regent Pacific move that they were supportive of changes the company had implemented. Keswick said the group was on track to replace ""low margin vanilla business"" with increased return per customer business. It had decided the best strategy was to undergo major upheavals for a year rather than piecemeal changes over a longer period in order to achieve this. Keswick, who forecast the benefits of the changes could take a year or two to come through, said he was pleased the group had moved back into profit, adding that the Investment Group's result had been particularly good. But Hambros chairman Lord Hambro warned that profits from this part of the business were not expected to match the first half in the rest of the year. However, he expected ""considerable improvement"" from Hambros' subsidiaries and, despite a challenging environment for the group as a whole, prospects were good. Lord Hambro said he would retire from his post in July 1997 and be succeeded by Keswick. ""Chips will inevitably be a hands-on chairman,"" Michael Sorkin, deputy chairman of Hambros Bank, said.

This view was supported by analysts who said the subject of Regent's shareholding and its calls for Hambros to sell its now successful Hambro Countrywide estate agency subsidiary was not raised at their meeting with the company. Hambros reported pretax profits of 35.0 million pounds ($57.81 million) for the first half, compared with a 7.7 million pound loss for the same period in 1995. Some analysts had forecast pretax profits of up to 45.0 million pounds based on a strong Hambro Countrywide performance. But they were disappointed by a worse-than-expected showing by Hambros' banking group. ""People are going to be downgrading their figures, they wre expecting better profits from the banking side,"" an analyst at one large investment bank told Reuters. He said it was disappointing Hambros had not done better in what were essentially good markets. ""Clearly the banking side is struggling to do anything. Countrywide is the star,"" he added. Analysts had predicted an interim dividend of 2.5 to 3.0 pence. In the event the dividend was unchanged at 2.5 pence. Hambros shares closed down 7.5 pence at 245 pence. Hambros is among a dwindling list of British investment banks which are the constant subject of takeover speculation. But it has been seen as one of the less attractive targets due to recent poor performance and major provisions for bad debts. ""I wouldn't have thought (a takeover) was terribly likely,"" said one analyst, adding that Hambros did not have the sort of distribution or securities operation an expanding investment bank would be seeking. Asked whether Hambros was a takeover target, Keswick said a public company was always in the firing line but he was happy with the group's direction.

"Shareholders in British property company Greycoat on Thursday left a large question-mark hanging over the future of the group, which is currently facing a break-up demand and a merger proposal from a smaller rival. Greycoat shareholders postponed for three weeks a vote on a proposal to sell off the company's 500 million pounds ($831.5 million) portfolio in anticipation of talks with predator Moorfield Estates, run by two former Goldman Sachs property analysts. But Greycoat said it still has to see concrete proposals from Moorfield, which wants a paper merger of the two and then a possible de-merger of Greycoat's largest property assets. ""We have yet to see any detailed proposals from Moorfield. As we keep saying we will consider those proposals once they are received. So far we have only seen one page of vague bullet points,"" a Greycoat spokesman told Reuters. The rebel investment fund shareholders which put forward the break-up resolution are the UK Active Value Fund, IMP UKAV Inc and Chaddesley Investments. They control 11 percent of the shares and are advised by Brian Myerson's Active Value Advisors. But at an extraordinary general meeting South African Myerson asked shareholders to put off a vote on their proposals for a controlled programme of disposals which he has said would significantly enhance shareholder value. This change in strategy came after Greycoat's chairman Michael Beckett told the meeting it had asked Moorfield to come up with a ""full and detailed proposal"" which, if forthcoming, it would ""consider carefully"". After a vote on postponement, carried by 53 million shares in favour versus about 42 million shares against, Myerson said, ""It's an overwhelming vote in favour of shareholder choice. We are supportive of Moorfield in terms of its proposals. We want the board to sit down with them."" Greycoat, which specialises in London property, said last week that the break-up resolution was not in shareholders' best interests and urged them to reject it. But news of the Moorfield approach surfaced over the weekend, adding another dimension to the uncertainty already hanging over the company and according to some analysts, holding down its share price which closed at 155-1/2p on Thursday. Moorfield said earlier this week that it would de-merge Greycoat's largest assets, its Embankment Place and 123 Buckingham Palace Road properties, and had earmarked some of its developments for immediate sale to a large property company. It said it plans to bring the remainder of the enlarged group's assets into an investment, trading and development portfolio and reorganise the board and management structure to reduce costs by at least 1.5 million pounds a year. Myerson told reporters after the meeting that the British property company would now be forced to talk to Moorfield. ""The (Greycoat) board will be forced to sit down and look at the Moorfield proposals,"" he said. Myerson said he was delighted shareholders had voted to adjourn his original proposal and repeated that his main object was to create shareholder value. He added the Moorfield proposals, which have so far been rejected by Greycoat as being too vague, had the backing of holders of 40 percent of Greycoat shares Myerson said these holders had already seen Moorfield's 40-page document and expressed their support for it, adding that he was ""supportive"" of both the proposals and the Moorfield management. ""We are supportive of Moorfield in terms of its proposals and we want it (the board) to sit down with them...We expect Moorfield to refine its proposals over the next couple of weeks,"" he added.

"Britain's investment watchdog on Thursday punished companies in the Robert Fleming group for rule breaches, with fines totalling 700,000 pounds ($1.09 million). At the same time Hong Kong authorities secured voluntary compensation of nearly $20 million from a company jointly owned by the Jardine Matheson and Robert Fleming groups. Britain's IMRO (the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation) handed down a 400,000 pound fine to Robert Fleming Asset Management (RFAM) and 100,000 pound penalties to three other firms in the group, while Hong Kong's SFC (Securities and Futures Commission) agreed the compensation package. Failings exposed by the investigation were accepted by Robert Fleming Asset Management, which regretted the breaches. ""We are embarrassed by it, there's no doubt about that,"" Paul Bateman, RFAM's chairman told Reuters in an interview. The disciplinary action resulted from a five-month joint investigation by IMRO and the SFC into dealing procedures at Jardine Fleming Investment Management (JFIM) and related companies, with the co-operation of all the firms involved. JFIM is a member of the Jardine Fleming group, The probe revealed Colin Armstrong, a former senior fund manager and director of JFIM had engaged in late allocation of deals after changes in the price of the instruments traded had occurred, the SFC said. His actions had resulted in three accounts managed by JFIM losing money and led to the group agreeing to make voluntary payments totalling $19.3 million to compensate these clients. Armstrong made ""substantial profits from trading in Japanese exchange traded options"" for his own account, the SFC said. He has since cooperated With JFIM and had paid back any gains. This has been used by JFIM as part of the compensation. ""The heart of the problem is JFIM. The weakness was their back office and procedures were not up to IMRO standards,"" said Bateman, adding the problem had been isolated to one fund manager, but said it had exposed systemic weakness. With hindsight he acknowledged that these procedural and compliance monitoring problems could and should have been spotted earlier but said it was difficult to tell how much quicker it could have been dealt with, although there had been a steady increase in the management response. Armstrong's behaviour had been an abuse of trust, but no decision had yet been made over whether it would result in court action, he added. Bateman said Armstrong had accepted the SFC termination of his registration as an investment adviser and securities dealer. ApaRt from fining the Robert Fleming subsidiaries that had delegated fund management of 1.2 billion pounds to JFIM, IMRO ended the registration of Robert Thomas, the former chief executive of JFAM and JFIM, who accepted he ""bore ultimate responsibility for the compliance failures in the companies"". JFAM has also had its authorisation brought to an end and the Jardine Fleming and Robert Fleming groups will offer its 10 customers But IMRO denied the penalties were insufficient either as punishment or a deterrent against future breaches. ""It always sends out a message to others when we take out a disciplinary action,"" an IMRO official told Reuters, adding the fines matched the scale of the breaches and the negative publicity would also have an effect. Bateman said the Robert Fleming group would be in close contact with all of its clients, but said he did not expect any material loss from the findings and clients had so far been ""understanding of the position"".

"Privately owned British investment bank Robert Fleming on Wednesday announced increased pre-tax profits for the first half of the year which it said underlined its ability to remain independent. ""We are committed to remaining independent. These results, our second best interim results ever, show we can remain independent,"" a Robert Fleming spokesman told Reuters. Flemings has been widely talked about as a possible takeover target for a larger foreign investment bank, but has resolutely said it would retain its independence. Flemings said its pretax profit for the first half of the year had increased by 16 percent to 92.2 million pounds ($154 million), from 79.4 million pounds a year earlier but warned it would have to cope with difficult markets in the second half. Some analysts said the increase was not particularly impressive given market conditions but chief executive John Manser said it was ""a very good start"" and showed new businesses were ""making a valuable contribution to profitability."" ""While the outlook for the year seems promising, flat Asian markets and heightened competitive pressures in other markets are factors that we will continue to have to contend with during the next six months,"" Manser said in a statement. The Flemings official said the results showed that while Flemings may have been perceived as an Asian-centric bank, it was now a much more international operation and had succeeded in bringing down its cost income ratio. Flemings has not had an easy year so far. In July it lost investment banking head Bill Harrison who was poached by BZW, the investment banking arm of Britain's Barclays. And in August Jardine Fleming, a joint venture with Jardine Matheson, revealed a five-month probe by British and Hong Kong regulators into irregular trades by a former senior fund manager at Jardine Fleming Investment Management. This resulted in hefty fines and voluntary compensation of nearly $20 million to clients. Regulators also withdrew the authorisation of Jardine Fleming's London-based fund company. In September the company's chairman retired and the group created a new supervisory board. Flemings acknowledged the problems at Jardine Fleming meant the joint venture had recorded a ""marginally lower"" interim result than its net interim profit of $63.9 million in 1995. This was after taking into account provisions ""arising from the regulatory issues relating to earlier years,"" it said. The Flemings spokesman told Reuters some clients had been lost, but new clients had also been taken on. He described the events as a ""painful experience."" ""But we believe we have clearly drawn a line in the sand,"" he added. Any impact these problems may have had on Flemings' overall business was not, however, reflected in the interim dividend which rose to eight pence per share from seven pence. Flemings said it had seen strong profit growth from its fund management businesses adding that its securities business had reported ""a marked increase in profits aided by a strong performance by UK and continental European broking."" Its capital markets arm had helped companies raise 13.4 billion pounds of new capital while its corporate finance division had completed 43 deals during the period. The appointment of Manser, 56, to replace Robin Fleming, 64, who will retire as chairman of Robert Fleming Holdings at the end of March 1997, means Manser would be more involved in business development and winning new business as well as strategy and relationships with major clients and shareholders. William Garrett, 50, who was hired by Manser as a fund manager in 1970, was named as his replacement as chief executive and chairman of the group executive committee.

"Mention moneylending to most Britons and their instant reaction is ""you mean loan-sharks!"". But Britain's established credit companies, which lend to people unable to borrow from the high street banks or credit card companies, say the public image of menacing debt collectors is a far cry from how they conduct their regulated business. ""We are credit collectors. A debt collector is someone who has no relationship with the customer. It's a totally different process,"" says Eddie Cran, chief executive of the financial services group Cattle's, which runs door-to-door moneylenders Shopacheck. Such firms are tied closely to the wheeling and dealing of the City of London. Provident Financial, Cattle's and London Scottish Bank are all publicly quoted, profitable firms paying shareholders annual dividends. People who borrow from them may have had minor civil court judgements against them, be unemployed or simply not want to have bank accounts or credit cards. The firms provide a service others -- except for unregulated outfits -- will not, and while it won't cost a pound of flesh, it is not cheap. To those used to credit cards or in-store credit the rates may appear outrageously high. But credit companies point out they include major costs such as collection and insurance, are agreed in advance and do not rise if a payment is missed. So while interest rates may be at all-time lows, these service charges mean the APRs (annualised percentage rate) can exceed 150 percent. To borrow 100 pounds ($167) over 25 weeks from Shopacheck with a five pound weekly repayment costs 25 pounds. Shopacheck, which started in the 1930s in northeast England, has 2,800 agents. Its average loan is for six months, the average amount 150 pounds and average indebtedness 350 pounds. STREET COLLECTING Only a few miles from the City, but a million miles from its hefty salaries and bonuses, Kathy, a self-employed agent for Shopacheck, does her weekly door-to-door collection of debt repayments through the streets of northwest London. The terraced suburban houses at which she stops are remarkably average. Most have front gardens, some are neatly laid out with blooming rose bushes while others are less well-kept, with tatty patches of litter-strewn grass. Inside there are the usual consumer trappings of late 1990s British life. Televisions, video-recorders, washing machines and microwave ovens, even the odd fish tank, are all in evidence, especially when crammed into a small council flat along with children, their toys, pets and piles of ironing. At each house Kathy, a 37-year-old mother of three, collects sums ranging from two pounds fifty to 20 pounds. Some customers take loans in the form of vouchers which can be spent only at certain high street shops, while others use the retail service offered by Shopacheck and buy items such as bed linen, beds or barbeques from the firm's own catalogue. Most of her clients seem to welcome her as a friend, they expect her visits and have the money ready to hand to her. Kathy says that, after eight years, she is a treated as a long-standing family friend or agony aunt by many of them. Only at one home does the son of the house come to the door and tell Kathy that his mother isn't in. ""Fine, can you tell her I'll see her as usual next week,"" says Kathy. But getting money back isn't always this easy. Kathy admits that if a customer threatens her, she passes the problem back to the company, which says it instructs its self-employed agents not to take personal risks. MONEYLENDERS PLUG GAP IN FINANCIAL SERVICES ""The one thing about credit is that it is easy to give but much harder to get back,"" says Paul Oliver, a Shopacheck regional manager who has been in the business for 27 years as customer, agent and manager. He is not alone as a successful businessman who has made use of Britain's long-standing system of moneylending. The managing director of one British bank confided he would not be where he is today had it not been for a money lending firm. His family could not afford to buy him a suit for an interview. He took a loan, bought the essential attire, got his first job and set himself on the path to greater things. Oliver says nine out of 10 times business is conducted with the woman of the house and although bad debts are expected, they only reach about four percent a year, which is good going for a business the mainstream lenders won't touch because of the risk. A recent television documentary showed some moneylenders breaking rules laid down by the Consumer Credit Act. Oliver says he deals harshly with anyone who steps outside the rules. For Cran firms such as his are plugging a gap in Britain's financial services marketplace and he is keen to correct what he sees as ""untrue perceptions"" about the business. ""What we are actually attempting to do is to deal with customers who cannot get credit through the mainstream lenders,"" Cran told Reuters. ""It (door-to-door lending) is very high cost and very personal. We have to train people to look after a number of customers,"" he added. A customer who fails to pay is only pursued through the courts ""as a very last measure"" and only in ""very extreme circumstances"" is an outside firm called in. Cran says Cattle's target market is about five-and-a-half million people, around two million of whom need the discipline of an agent calling to collect every week. But the stigma involved means Cattle's also offers Welcome, a loans service for people who have bank accounts and pay by direct debit. This ""requires a very high rejection rate and an in-depth granting procedure"", Cran says. SHAREHOLDERS REAP THE DIVIDENDS For Cattle's and its competitors credit is a lucrative business. In September it reported increased pre-tax profits for the first six months of the year of nearly 15.0 million pounds. In 1995 its shareholders received a total dividend of 6.9 pence. In August Provident Financial, the sector's biggest player, reported first half pre-tax profits of 47.5 million pounds. It said it had seen continued growth in home collected credit and was confident of a ""good result"" for the year as a whole. But for customers, things might not be so rosy. While most manage to pay back their loans, some do not. Kathy soon spots trouble. ""You can see they are struggling if they start having to scrabble around for pennies,"" she says.

"British venture capital firm 3i Group Plc on Thursday reported a rise in first half net asset value (NAV) per share and revenue profits but said it had been held back by continental Europe and a strong pound. 3i's NAV for the period rose to 454 pence per share, from 426 pence in the first half last year, while profit before tax rose to 62.9 million pounds ($106 million) from 54.3 million. ""Its a pretty healthy increase.

There were still plenty of opportunities available, he said, with the sort of companies that 3i invested in doing very well. There had also been an improvement in general business confidence in Britain, which had improved for the fourth consecutive quarter, according to 3i's latest ""Enterprise Barometer"" survey. Of 327 million pounds invested by 3i during the period, 284 million was in Britain. Macpherson said the prospect of a general election in Britain by May 1997, had resulted in a number of investment opportunities for 3i as some company founders or management teams decided to sell their corporate holdings while the tax regime remained clear. While the European performance had an impact on the NAV figure, the investment opportunities for 3i on the continent remained good, Macpherson said. Current pricing levels for small and medium-sized European companies in which the group invests were ""very attractive"". During the first half of the year, realisation of investments continued at an encouraging rate, with sales worth 122 million pounds in Britain and some 36 million pounds in continental Europe. Macpherson said the group had ""significant plans to expand in Europe"" and this was reflected in its decision to open an office in the German city of Duesseldorf in January. This regionalisation would also involve opening offices in three other German cities -- Hamburg, Munich and Stuttgart -- and the group also plans to extend its presence into the south of France. The group said it wanted to open its first office in Southeast Asia, in Singapore, early in 1997. Macpherson said Asia was ""an exciting part of the world"" for investment capital and Singapore had been chosen as it was a good communication centre from which other parts of the region could be covered. He said the office would look at opportunities in Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia but not in China. ($1=.5956 Pound) ",AlexanderSmith
"UK investment capital group 3i Group Plc said on Thursday the increase in its first half net asset value (NAV) per share was healthy but had been partly held back by continental Europe and a strong pound. ""Its a pretty healthy increase. Its held back a bit by continental Europe...the markets have not been that good and there has also been the appreciation of sterling,"" Ewen Macpherson, 3i's chief executive told Reuters. 3i's NAV for the period rose to 454 pence per share, from 426 pence for the same period the previous year.   Macpherson said a better indication of the group's performance was its UK portfolio which had performed ""extremely well"", reflected in an 18 percent growth in revenue. He said there were still plenty of opportunities available, with the sort of companies that 3i invested in doing very well. There had also been an improvement in general business confidence in the UK, which had improved for the fourth consecutive quarter according to 3i's latest survey. ""The confidence in the businesses underlying our portfolio has been so positive,"" he said. Of 327.3 million stg invested by 3i during the period, 284.2 million stg was in the UK.   Macpherson said the prospect of a general election in the UK, which must be held by May 1997, had resulted in a number of investment opportunities for 3i as some company founders or management teams decided to sell their holdings in a firm while there was no doubt about the tax implications. While the European performance had an impact on the NAV figure, the investment opportunities for 3i on the continent remained good, Macpherson said, adding that current pricing levels for the small and medium-sized European companies in which the group invests were ""very attractive"".   During the first half of the year, 3i said, realisations on investments had continued ""at an encouraging rate"".

Macpherson said the group had ""significant plans to expand in Europe"" and this was reflected in its decision to open an office in Dusseldorf, Germany in January. This regionalisation would involve opening offices in Hamburg, Munich and Stuttgart. And the group was also planning to extend its presence into the south of France, he added.   The group also announced it would open its first office in South East Asia, in Singapore, early in 1997. Macpherson said the area was ""an exciting part of the world"" for investment capital and Singapore had been chosen as it was a good communication centre from which other parts of the region could be covered. He said the office would start small, with a staff of three, and would have a maximum of ""half-a-dozen"" people for the first year or so and would look at opportunities in Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia but not in China. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7719 ",AlexanderSmith
"The British arm of accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand, auditors for failed British bank Barings, said on Friday it had issued third party proceedings against nine former directors and employees of the bank. ""Despite the fact that we are not responsible for the collapse of Barings, we face a substantial claim. We are perceived to have deep pockets which are available to those who have lost money while those who were really responsible for the collapse of Barings escape,"" Coopers said in a statement. ""We may also take additional third party proceedings against other members of Barings management in due course,"" it added. Coopers &amp; Lybrand's British firm was auditor for Barings Plc, the parent company. Barings was rescued by Dutch financial giant ING Groep after it collapsed in February 1995 under losses of around $1.4 billion run up by the unauthorised derivatives trades of Singapore-based Nick Leeson. Leeson is currently serving a six-and-a-half year jail sentence in Singapore for his part in the bank's downfall. Ernst &amp; Young, administrators to the bank, later issued claims of negligence in audits against accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand in London and Singapore and Deloitte &amp; Touche in Singapore. Some commentators estimate the total amount of these writs, which have not been specified, to be around 1.0 billion pounds ($1.68 billion). A Coopers &amp; Lybrand official in London said no amount had been specified on the writ issued against it. A spokesman at Ernst &amp; Young told Reuters the firm was aware of the third party writs issued by Coopers but said that it was ""inappropriate to comment at this stage."" The Coopers &amp; Lybrand official said the third party writs against the nine former Barings directors and employees had not yet been served, adding it had four months in which to do so. The firm said in a statement that the writs had been issued in the Chancery Division of the High Court against former Baring Investment Bank head Peter Norris and former deputy chairman Andrew Tuckey as well as Ron Baker, Mary Walz, Ian Hopkins, Anthony Gamby, Geoffrey Broadhurst, James Bax and Simon Jones. Baker's lawyer, Lindsay Hill of law firm Fox Williams, told Reuters he was surprised Coopers &amp; Lybrand had taken the action against Baker. ""I am surprised that Coopers &amp; Lybrand should have taken this sort of action against Mr. Baker. I think the way events have unfolded before the SFA (Securities and Futures Authority) have demonstrated that he has not been in breach of any of his obligations or duties as a director,"" Hill said. He said he did not expect Coopers &amp; Lybrand to be successful in any claim against Baker and suggested that issuing the writs had been ""a tactical move intended to divert attention away from the main action."" Earlier this month Baker was cleared of most misconduct charges brought by the SFA, a British financial markets watchdog, after a hearing by an independent tribunal. Norris, who along with Broadhurst was banned from working in the City of London by the SFA in May, could not be contacted by Reuters. Tuckey, who was deputy chairman of Barings, was not disciplined by the SFA. In March the SFA said it ""found no evidence indicating that the insolvency of the group"" could be attributed to his actions. But he had to assure the SFA he would not seek any position in an investment house which would require his registration by the SFA as a senior executive officer or as a director unless his duties were limited to giving corporate finance advice. Gamby was reprimanded by the SFA in August. He had his registration as a director suspended for a year and was required to pay 5,000 pounds towards costs. SFA proceedings against Walz, Hopkins and Bax have yet to be concluded, while Jones was not regulated by the watchdog. ($1=.5953 Pound) ",AlexanderSmith
"Singapore's Hotel Properties and property group Canary Wharf on Friday applied for detailed planning consent for a development aimed at injecting life into an office-dominated area of London's former docks. ""Life means people who stay here. We looked at what was lacking (in Canary Wharf) and that was life,"" Thio Gim Hock, executive director of HPL, told Reuters in an interview. HPL and Canary Wharf, which is owned by an international consortium led by Paul Reichmann and including Prince Al Waleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz al Saud of Saudi Arabia, formed an 80-20 joint venture for the residential, hotel and leisure project. The multi-million pound scheme represents the first phase of development of an 11-acre (4.5 hectare) site adjoining the River Thames. It will be part of the landmark Canary Wharf docklands development to the east of the City financial district, home to Britain's tallest building. The development will be the first at the massive Canary Wharf site since an agreement last year by banks to sell out to the Reichmann-led consortium. The banks had taken over the ownership when the original development company went into administration. Despite these problems, 80 percent of the offices have now been occupied and Canary Wharf is vying with the London's traditional financial heartland as a site for large global investment banks to locate their new headquarters. Office blocks have so far dominated the site, however, and Thio Gim Hock said he expects to start building 330 residential units, a five star hotel and sports club early in 1997. They are due to be completed by the end of 1998 or early 1999. There is already outline planning permission from the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) to develop the site and Canary Wharf's Robert John, a director of the joint venture, believes detailed permission should be granted. An initial capitalisation of 50 million pounds ($83.95 million) will come from the partners. Further funding is expected to come from sale of apartments and bank loans, although Thio Gim Hock would not be drawn on the financing. HPL, which has a stake in Britain's Virgin Cinemas as well as interests in hotels such as Four Seasons and residential developments, said in July the Canary Wharf scheme would cost around 250 million pounds, although the total cost is likely to be higher given the estimates for the first phase. Designer Philippe Stark is to shape the hotel and leisure component of the new development, which will include a glass-covered ""infinity"" swimming pool which will give the appearance of dropping into the river Thames below. Thio Gim Hock said Stark will ""give some sex appeal to the development"", which he says will have a country club atmosphere. He wants the hotel to have its own distinctive character which will be ""elegant, understated and aimed at business people"". The developers also envisage opportunities for top-class restaurants with river views on the site. He expects many of the apartments to be sold to people in Britain, but also hopes for overseas interest and foresees some buyers seeking an investment rather than a place to live. HPL's track-record in Singapore will, he said, encourage interest from the company's home patch. ""I have no doubt that a lot of them will come and buy here."" Work on the Canary Wharf project in the former London docks began in 1987 under Olympia and York, owned by the Reichmann family of Canada. But in May 1992 Olympia and York Canary Wharf Ltd went into administration and was rescued by a group of banks that had financed the project in October 1993. ($1=.5956 Pound) ",AlexanderSmith
"Embattled British property company Greycoat had the immediate threat of a shareholder call for its break-up removed on Thursday, but the firm still faced an unwanted merger proposal from a smaller rival. Greycoat welcomed an overwhelming vote against the breakup resolution put forward by the UK Active Value Fund (UKAV) and chief executive Peter Thornton said he hoped the group could now get on with its normal business. ""It has cost us a lot of money and a lot of wasted effort and time. What we would like to do is get on with running a property company,"" Thornton said in an interview. He was speaking after the vote by Greycoat shareholders on UKAV's call for the sale of all Greycoat's 500 million pound ($811.6 million) assets. Among Greycoat sharholders, 95 percent of those who voted, representing 55 percent of the share capital, voted against the sale. Shares in Greycoat closed unchanged at 163.5 pence, compared with a year high of 168 pence and a low of 130 pence. UKAV, which is advised by South African Brian Myerson's Active Value Advisers, said on Wednesday it would abstain at the reconvened extraordinary general meeting. It argued it had already achieved one of its main aims, the sale of Greycoat's largest asset, Embankment Place, on the River Thames in central London. It now thought a merger proposal from Moorfield Estates had ""considerable merit and could better serve the interests of Greycoat shareholders"". Thornton welcomed the fact that one uncertain element surrrounding the group was over, adding Greycoat had yet to receive the answers needed about the Moorfield merger proposal. ""We still haven't received answers to our 30-odd questions,"" he said of the Moorfield approach, adding Greycoat was not prepared to embark on a due diligence exercise or open its books to Moorfield without more concrete details of the firm's plans. Moorfield has suggested demerging Greycoat's largest assets, but Thornton said it had yet to convince him it had proposals that would work. Moorfield shares were also unchanged at 30.5 pence, compared with a year high of 34 pence and a low of 24 pence. Thornton said relations with potential purchasers had been established but there were fairly few buyers in the world able to pay more than 200 million pounds ($324.6 million). But he said he could not quantify how much losing the opportunity of an ""off market"" sale might shave off the sale price. ($1=.6161 Pound) ",AlexanderSmith
"British property group MEPC on Thursday announced a 14 percent increase in pretax profits for the year but said a writedown on a Los Angeles shopping mall had reduced its net asset value (NAV). MEPC's chief executive said he was pleased with the rise in pretax profits to 140 million pounds ($227.2 million) from 122.6 million pounds the previous year, but admitted disappointment at the fall in NAV to 450 pence per share from 457 pence. MEPC shares were 11p lower at 441-1/2p by 1218 GMT as traders said the NAV was below market expectations. ""We feel very confident about the whole of the profit statement. The only slight disappointment is on the NAV side,"" Tuckey said in an interview. Earnings per share rose nine percent to 22.9 pence and the total dividend stayed at 20 pence. Tuckey said the NAV drop reflected a marginal fall in values both in Britain and elsewhere but it was less than the relevant indices. ""We feel that the performance of our UK portfolio, which accounts for 70 percent of the group, is indeed where we would have expected it to be."" He pointed out the valuation date for the portfolio was August 31 and there had been activity and evidence of an improved market since then. ""If we redid the valuation for December 1, we would probably get a different answer,"" he said. The other factor which had brought the NAV down was the 31 million pound write-down on the valuation of MEPC's Northridge Mall. This had been equivalent to 7.5 pence per share. ""We are convinced this is a temporary write-down because the centre is still getting back on its feet after the earthquake some three years ago. We are quite confident we will get that value back in the next two to three years as the centre re-establishes itself,"" he said. And he defended MEPC's decision to give a target NAV of 690 pence per share for 2001. ""We're sticking our necks out...The portfolio is very very different to what it was three years ago and what we're trying to do is give shareholders some feel of where we think the performance is going to be in five years time,"" Tuckey said. Tuckey said the full impact of the change of strategy in MEPC's portfolio would take time but there would be progress towards the firm's targets each year. He said there was a much firmer tone to the markets, particularly in Britain over the last few months. Apart from Northridge, the rest of the U.S. portfolio had performed ""extremely well"". MEPC plans to keep the lion's share of its portfolio in Britain, with the remainder in the United States and Australia. It has wound down its European portfolio and has no plans to go back into continental Europe in the immediate future. Tuckey said the group was keen to make acquisitions, with the proceeds of its European disposals, but that there was a shortage of good stock available, particularly in Britain. While MEPC has resolved to increase the dividend paid to shareholders, Tuckey said he could not predict when it would be increased although he pointed out that dividend cover had improved to 1.15 times from 1.05 a year before. ""It depends on the forward look, on how the markets are feeling,"" he said. The market was competitive and good stock was hard to find but Tuckey said he welcomed the prospect of changes to the way the market functioned with more liquidity likely.

"It may sound like a dull backwater but the role of compliance has again been thrust into the limelight as yet another respected financial institution was rapped by the authorities this week for breaking the rules. Compliance officials play a key role in banking and finance, ensuring procedures to safeguard against fraud and malpractice are adhered to from the back office to the board room. On Thursday British investment watchdog IMRO fined companies in the Robert Fleming group 700,000 pounds ($1.09 million) and Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) secured voluntary compensation of nearly $20 million from a Robert Fleming and Jardine Matheson joint venture. These punishments stemmed from compliance violations which also saw two individuals banned from the markets. A compliance officer at a top international investment bank, who did not want to be named, told Reuters the irregular dealing leading to the probe was ""as old as the hills"". And it was something the right checks and balances should have avoided. ""I'm surprised that something as old as this has cropped up again. It's the sort of thing that any compliance officer worth his salt should have his eye open for,"" he added. The joint IMRO and SFC investigation revealed that Colin Armstrong, a former senior fund manager at Jardine Fleming Investment Management, had made profits for his own account by the late allocation of deals, thereby depriving client accounts. Compliance industry insiders said a number of red flags might have warned those in charge that something was amiss far earlier and thereby prevented much of the damage. Larger-than-life characters and big earners are often left to their own devices and not investigated until too late. Compliance officers first started appearing in London firms about 10 years ago, but the profile has changed significantly over this period, with many coming from the ranks of accountants and lawyers and seeking a career in the area. Industry sources say top-ranking individuals can now earn as much as 100,000 pounds a year, including bonuses, which although falling short of what dealers earn, is attracting good people. For a system of compliance with both internal and external rules and regulations to be wholly effective, the personnel involved not only need to be top notch, they must also have adequate resources and the full backing of senior management. ""The chief executive officer is personally accountable for compliance,"" the first source said. This means ensuring rules are not breached is not only in the interests of the firm, but also a question of self-preservation for the CEO. In the Robert Fleming Asset Management (RFAM) probe, RFAM's former chief executive Robert Thomas accepted he ""bore ultimate responsibility for the compliance failures..."". As a result Thomas had his registration with IMRO ended. In order to prevent the kind of dealing that Armstrong was engaged in, adequate separation between front and back offices, where the deals are struck and where they are processed, and strict rules on the use of personal accounts are critical. Market sources noted similarities with Barings, where one of the main criticisms was that Nick Leeson, the trader who stacked up the losses which led to its collapse, was responsible not only for executing trades but settling or matching them as well. This made it unlikely that any discrepancies in his trading would be uncovered in the back office, the sort of loophole regulators such as IMRO look for when they inspect firms. Insiders said the Jardine Fleming outcome was a good result for the British watchdog, which came under fire for its handling of previous cases. ""If you find a major problem you tell them. If it's a serious problem you tell them immediately, you certainly wouldn't sit on it,"" said one. And while the incidence of breaches may appear to be on the rise, it can be argued that the trend shows the net is tightening. But even the best systems will not prevent mistakes. ""Even the best of us make mistakes. If you are a large firm problems do arise, if you find them then you take remedial action. There will always be fools, crooks and incompetents,"" the first compliance source said. ($1=.6420 Pound) ",AlexanderSmith
"Members of the Transport and General Workers Union (T&amp;G) at Tradeteam, the distribution arm of the brewing operation of Britain's Bass Plc, are to vote on strike action over proposed pay cuts, the union said on Friday. The union said in a statement that the ballot of more than 1,000 workers at Tradeteam would start on December 9 and the result would be known on December 20. Bass said there was no threat to the delivery of drinks to its customers in the run up to the busy Christmas period. The T&amp;G said the ballot was going ahead after an attempt by Tradeteam, a joint venture between Bass and NFC, to have it halted by a legal injunction failed on Friday. ""Since Bass established Tradeteam in a joint venture with Exel Logistics, management has been trying to cut wages by 100 stg per week and impose inferior working conditions in order to save 10 million stg a year,"" the union said. It said Tradeteam had also rejected T&amp;G attempts to establish national bargaining. The T&amp;G said a Liverpool judge had refused to grant an injunction to stop the ballot. ""Bass Brewers Ltd is a very profitable company, which made over 157 million pounds profit over the last year. Their aim at Tradeteam has been to cut the wages of draymen and warehouse workers, many of whom have given over 20 years' loyal service to the company,"" T&amp;G national secretary for the drinks industry Brian Revell said. Draymen deliver beer and other drinks to pubs. ""I am pleased that the judge refused the injunction. We are prepared for a long battle with Bass until it honours its responsibilities,"" he added. A spokesman for Tradeteam, which is 50.1 percent owned by NFC, denied a trade dispute existed with the union. ""There is no trade dispute with the T&amp;G. Current settlements on pay and conditions between Tradeteam and its staff represented by the T&amp;G have been made with full agreement of the T&amp;G at local branch level,"" he told Reuters. ""To agree to national wage agreements would mean Tradeteam would be totally out of step with the rest of the industry."" He said the union had been involved throughout the consultation process. This had resulted in the current terms and conditions for staff at each of the local offices at which the T&amp;G was represented, he added. Bass Brewers said the decision to vote on strike action would not affect beer deliveries over Christmas. ""Obviously the strike issue is one for Tradeteam but we want to reassure customers this will not affect their beer deliveries during or before the Christmas period,"" Stewart Cain of Bass Brewers told Reuters. Earlier this week brewer-to-leisure group Bass, the parent company, said it planned to spend 670 million pounds on the business next year, creating some 7,000 jobs. It said it planned a 300 million pounds investment programme over the next year on its Bass Taverns, converting many pubs to branded concept bars. ",AlexanderSmith
"Former Barings executive Ron Baker plans to bring a counter-claim in a lawsuit against him by Dutch bank ING Barings for repayment of a loan he is alleged to have received, his lawyer told Reuters on Friday. ""He (Baker) plans to bring in his own counter-claim into those proceedings and they will be heard together unless some sort of arrangement is reached beforehand,"" Lindsay Hill, a partner at London law firm Fox Williams said. ING Barings last month confirmed it was suing Baker for 113,000 pounds ($185,800), representing a 100,000 pound loan allegedly given to Baker when he was at Barings, plus interest. British merchant bank Barings collapsed in February 1995 amid losses of around $1.4 billion run up by the unauthorised derivatives trades of Singapore-based trader Nick Leeson. It was rescued by ING which formed ING Barings as its investment banking arm. Leeson is currently serving a six-and-a-half year jail sentence in Singapore for his part in the bank's downfall. But the saga looks set to run on for some time, with writs filed by administrators of the bank against the former auditors and subsequent third party proceedings being issued against former bosses, including Baker. Hill said Baker would contest the ING Barings case against him and his counter-claim would be for an unpaid bonus. ""He believes that the monies that he was promised by way of bonus remain due and are outstanding so yes, they will come into the equation in terms of resolving the dispute with ING Barings,"" Hill said. Baker would not be the first to attempt to force ING Barings to pay a bonus which had apparently been promised before the collapse of Barings itself and ING's takeover. But Hill said the decision by a London industrial tribunal on Thursday to reject a claim by another former Barings executive for an allegedly unpaid bonus had no implications for Baker's case. ""It's a different case, it's for different sums of money and the circumstances are not the same,"" Hill said. Mary Walz, who was global head of equity financial products at Barings Investment Bank, had her 500,000 pound claim, which she said she was told was ""set in stone"" by her former Barings bosses, thrown out by the tribunal. Hill declined to say how much Baker's counter-claim would be for but said the sum was ""substantial"". ",AlexanderSmith
"The debt restructuring package hammered out between Anglo-French Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel and its creditors may not be able to withstand any extra financial demands resulting from last month's fire, secondary debt trading firm Klesch &amp; Co said on Thursday. ""The recent fire onboard a Eurotunnel HGV shuttle has now raised fundamental safety concerns, with potentially dire (but as yet unquantifiable) long-term implications,"" Klesch &amp; Co said in a report on the restructuring plans.   It said from an investment viewpoint the events ""call into question the likely adequacy of the financial restructuring package as currently proposed"" but acknowledged the immediate impact on Eurotunnel's revenues ""is likely to be minor."" The report said that according to its calculations, the multi-billion pound debt restructuring hammered out between Eurotunnel and a group of 225 creditor banks, which was finally agreed in October, had only left the company with ""headroom,"" or contingency reserve, of 600 million pounds ($990.7 million), or around 67 million pounds a year over nine years.   ""Any development (such as the fire) which has the potential to impact future revenues or operating efficiency, could threaten the suffciency of a financial restructuring package."" Passenger car shuttle services resumed through the tunnel on Tuesday, three weeks after the fire closed the undersea link. The fire on a truck destroyed a freight vehicle and damaged a section of the tunnel. Thirty-four people were injured.   Rail services for passengers between Paris and London and Brussels and London resumed last week but no date has been set for a resumption of the shuttle service for trucks. The report said that in the aftermath of the fire the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority would have to consider the design and operation of the open-lattice freight carriers. ""Should (it) decide that fundamental changes will be required to the HGV shuttles, the potential for a reduction in revenues and/or increases in costs could reduce the contingency made available by the restructuring,"" it added. Klesch &amp; Co also pointed out the fire had highlighted that Eurotunnel ""consists in its entirety of a single, high profile, effectively irreplaceable, hugely expensive and vulnerable operating asset,"" a factor at the core of its concerns.

"Following a bumper year in 1996, yet more British companies are likely to be takeover targets in 1997, but much of the merger and acquisition activity will be in the form of agreed deals, corporate financiers say. ""We certainly see the first quarter of next year being very active. There are a lot of transactions in the pipeline, a lot of activity,"" Rupert Faure Walker, head of corporate finance at HSBC Samuel Montagu, told Reuters. Britain is still regarded as the European leader for takeover activity. ""The markets here have always been more open than elsewhere, with not many constraints to other companies coming over here,"" another senior corporate financier said. In the first nine months of 1996, 278 British companies valued at 14.4 billion pounds ($23.99 billion) were sold in cross-border deals, compared to 258 firms worth 19.1 billion pounds in the same period a year earlier. Faure Walker said most of the deals in the pipeline were agreed rather than contested, with a number of strategic mergers reflecting industry rationalisations and cost eliminations. Others said consolidation and deconsolidation would both be driving forces behind activity in the year ahead. ELECTION TO SET BUSINESS TEMPO But while the outlook for the first quarter of the year looks promising for the corporate financiers who earn their fees by advising either acquirer or target, political influences are likely to colour how the market progresses, with the result of the impending general election the major force at work. ""The big thing next year is the election,"" said Faure Walker, adding that the election of a new goverment was likely to introduce a note of caution into the market. This view was backed by the second corporate financier who said there could be some slowing of activity ahead of the election as companies did their best to avoid a deal being straddled across an election period. Britain's opposition Labour party has consistently been ahead of the ruling Conservatives in the opinion polls and an election is due to be called by May. If Labour wins, companies could take some time to adjust to the new environment and could wait until after a first Labour budget before making any significant moves. For a typical large acquisition this could result a 6-9 month period of caution, some industry players said, although others said activity was likely to continue whatever the government. TAKEOVERS TO TAKE IN MORE SECTORS A broader spread of takeovers, evident during 1996, is expected to run into 1997 as companies play ""catch-up"" after a period of caution following the recession of the early 1990s. Formerly publicly-owned utilities, including the few remaining regional electricity suppliers, will be joined by insurance brokers struggling with declining rates and a host of others. ""The inevitable reconstruction of industries will continue. The pace will quicken,"" the second corporate financier said. The tendency towards agreed deals also reflected the fact that Britain's Office of Fair Trading had largely referred contested deals to the department of trade and industry (DTI) in recent months rather than agreed bids, financiers said. REMAINING RECS SET TO FALL In the electricity sector, the remaining privatised regional electricity companies (RECs) are viewed as likely targets for U.S. predators. Southern Electric and Yorkshire Electricity are tipped to follow recent takeover targets Northern Electric and London Electricity into U.S. hands. With only two RECs remaining, some analysts suggest attention will now turn to the water companies, with further takeovers among them. SMALLER FINANCIAL PLAYERS TO FEEL THE PINCH The financial services sector is also seen as a hot-bed for further takeovers with perennials such as merchant banks Schroders, Hambros, and Robert Fleming all possible targets for larger global investment banks. Further consolidation among small, specialist City of London and regional boutiques is also likely and Britain's dwindling club of large mutually-owned building societies could also attract attention from larger groups. In the insurance sector Commercial Union is seen as a likely bid target or merger partner after widespread rumours suggesting talks with the financial services arm of B.A.T. It has also been linked with General Accident and Guardian Royal Exchange. Among the insurance brokers, talk of consolidation as firms try to cut costs in the face of declining rates and overcapacity has been fuelled by recent mergers such as Lloyd Thompson and JIB. Willis Corroon and Sedgwick have long been rumoured to be possible merger or takeover candidates. TELECOMS TO RING IN MORE CHANGES Corporate financiers see the telecommunications and media sectors as providing significant merger activity during 1997, with Vodafone, cable group Telewest and Orange all tipped as possible targets. There have also been suggestions that Mercury One-2-One may join Mercury Communications and that British Telecom may buy out its 40 percent partner in Cellnet. Energis, the cable company owned by National Grid, has been valued by some at 600 million pounds, while privately-owned Ionica also has long-term plans to float. Among media companies, HTV, Yorkshire Tyne Tees and STV have all been suggested as possible targets, with Pearson an outside contender. In the growing sector of publicly quoted football clubs, Manchester United has obvious appeal. OIL AND GAS TO REMAIN IGNITED The demerger of British Gas into separate trading and transport firms in February has led to widespread market speculation that an oil major could be interested in buying the trading arm, to be called Centrica. Worldwide consolidation in the oil industry is seen also affecting British firms. Smaller exploration and production firms might be eyed by the big players, all cash-rich after years of cost-cutting and keen to boost oil and gas reserves. Other firms tipped to face takeover attempts are DIY retailer Wickes, defence to electronics group Racal, auto-components group T&amp;N, construction group Costain and Imperial Tobacco. Energy, currently part of Hanson but due to be demerged next year, is not expected to be left uncourted for long. Britain's drink companies are entering a period of steady, organic growth which precludes any major acquisitions. But Allied Domecq, Grand Met and Guinness have been dissuaded from pursuing the idea of demergers. The major food companies are also looking to prune their brand portfolios to allow a more concentrated marketing push behind core brands with international appeal. This strategy will involve disposal programmes and small bolt-on acquisitions. Bass and Guinness, Associated British Foods and Tate &amp; Lyle are all sufficiently cash-rich to launch sizeable takeovers. ",AlexanderSmith
"Britain's Takeover Panel, after battling to defend its policing role of London's busy mergers and acquisitions market against European interference, has ended the year in the spotlight over its handling of CE Electric's bid for Northern Electric. The non-statutory body has spent much of 1996 campaigning against a framework European Union proposal on takeover bids which it says will lead to multi-million pound lawsuits and harm London's system of takeover regulation. But on Monday the panel's own role was under scrutiny as the outcome of a bitter bid battle between U.S. group CE and British utility Northern hung in the balance. ""What is going on at the moment is being watched pretty closely. It is a fairly unique situation,"" a financial services lawyer said. Criticism of the part the panel has played stems from a 250,000 pound ($418,600) payment made by Northern to one of its advisors, BZW, the investment banking arm of British banking giant Barclays Plc. BZW said this was a discretionary fee and denied that it was linked to its purchase last week of Northern shares, which had already been allowed by the panel. After it was told of the payment, the panel extended the deadline for acceptances. After the official close of the offer last Friday, Northern would have remained independent as CE had only achieved the support of 49.77 percent of Northern shareholders. But following the extension, CE said on Monday it had 50.13 percent. A source close to the discussions said it was ""very unusual and maybe unique"" for the panel to be in the position of deciding the fate of a company in this way. This view was echoed by other market participants. ""This is an unndented step the panel has taken,"" one investment banking source told Reuters of the decision to grant an extension to the offer period at such a late stage. Northern's fate now lies in the panel's hands. The company has said it wants to appeal against the decision and revert to the result at the original end of the offer period. Acceptances after the initial deadline require the panel's approval. ""They (the panel) now find themselves in a very difficult situation,"" the investment banking source added. Any changes in the way in which the panel operates must either come from government, by bringing in legislation to establish a statutory force to regulate takeovers, or from within the body itself, market players said. Pressure from industry participants could lead to the panel making changes itself. ""They can change the ""Blue Book"" (the rule book regulating takeovers) at the drop of a hat,"" one industry source said, adding that it had so far managed the system well. ""The panel seemed to be coping well with the upturn in bid activity. The system seemed to be working pretty well,"" he said. Mergers and acquisitions activity has reached peak levels in recent weeks, with a number of both agreed and disputed bids. Apart from the potential threat from the European takeover directive, there had ""been no major challenges to the panel's authority over the year"", he added. Even if the ruling Conservative Party loses a general election which must be held by next May, market participants said they did not expect pressure for legislation to put the panel on a statutory footing under a Labour government. ""The general feeling is pretty much against it (legislation) and the indications so far ist change it,"" said one. ",AlexanderSmith
"CE Electric, the U.S. energy group, appeared poised to win its hostile bid for British regional electricity group Northern Electric Plc on Tuesday after Britain's Takeover Panel ruled against the target firm. Late on Monday night the British company lost an appeal to the panel, which polices London's mergers and acquisitions market, to reverse an extension of the offer period for CE's 782 million pound ($1.3 billion) bid to 1300 GMT on Tuesday. On Monday morning CE, which is controlled by CalEnergy Co Inc, said it had received acceptances totalling just over the 50 percent mark needed for victory. The offer was meant to close last Friday but was extended after an appeal by CE. This extension was granted because CE raised concerns about the purchase of Northern Electric shares last week by its advisers British merchant bank Schroders and BZW, the investment banking arm of Barclays, and a discretionary payment of 250,000 pounds to BZW but not declared until Friday. In its statement the panel said it had only been informed of the payment early on Friday but that while ""neither element of the fee arrangement was dependent upon the success or failure of the offer"", it was ""material information which ought to have been made known to the executive"" earlier in the week. Northern in turn launched its own appeal against the extension of the deadline because at the time of the first deadline, CE had only gathered support totalling 49.77 percent and therefore fell short of the total needed to win. But after a day of uncertainty on Monday, the panel said its appeal committee had ""unanimously dismissed"" Northern's appeal, that the latest time for acceptance of CE's offer should be extended and ""any valid acceptances and withdrawals received by the latter time should be taken into account"". The panel also said the non-disclosure ""may have had market consequences affecting the outcome of the bid, bearing in mind the narrow margin between success and failure in this case"". CE officials were not immediately available for comment but Northern, which has fought off CE's approach from the beginning claiming it undervalued the company, refused to throw in the towel and urged shareholders who had indicated they would accept CE's 650 pence per share offer to think again. ""It is now up to the market to decide. If shareholders do not wish this bid to succeed they should deliver withdrawals of acceptances to the Royal Bank of Scotland by 1300 on Tuesday,"" a spokesman for Northern Electric told Reuters after the ruling. The spokesman said that in the event of the CE bid lapsing, Northern was willing to ""attempt to reach agreement with CE Electric or any other bidder on the true value of the company"". By agreeing to effectively ""collapse"" a rule which says a bidder cannot come back and bid for the same company within a 12 month-period, the spokesman said Northern was opening the way for shareholders to withdraw their acceptances and reopen the debate about the value of the company. BZW, which as a result of not declaring the discretionary fee from Northern at the appropriate time will not now be paid this part, said it had done nothing wrong. ""BZW has at all times acted in good faith and has risked its own capital in support of Northern's defence. Our fee arrangement was in no way contingent upon the purchase of Northern shares and the panel has permitted this purchase to stand,"" a spokesman for the firm told Reuters. This is not the first time such uncertainty has surrounded Northern's future since it was privatised along with its 11 regional electricity company (REC) peers in 1990. In 1994 it was the first of the cash-rich RECs to face a takeover and successfully fought off -- partly with the help of an extraordinary 560 million pound defence package -- a bid by conglomerate Trafalgar House, now owned by Norway's Kvaerner ASA. If CE's bid goes through only two of the original RECs will remain independent, Yorkshire Electricity and Southern Electric.   ""It is now up to the market,"" Northern said, calling for shareholders to withdraw their shares from CE's offer by 1300 GMT on Tuesday, the deadline for the hostile bid. ""In the event that this bid lapses, the board is willing...to enter into discussions with CE Electric, or any other party, with a view to reaching agreement on an improved offer for Northern Electric,"" the utility said in a statement. On Monday morning, CE said it had received acceptances totalling just over the 50 percent needed for victory. CE's offer had been due to end on Friday, when it had only gathered support totalling 49.77 percent of the total. However, the Takeover Panel extended the deadline after CE appealed, questioning the purchase of Northern Electric shares by its advisers, Schroders and BZW, and a discretionary payment of 250,000 pounds to BZW.

"Increased confidence means a third of British companies expect to raise property holdings over the next six months, according to a survey by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and property consultants Grimley. ""Business confidence has strengthened markedly compared with six months ago and companies expect a further pick-up in business, led by domestic demand,"" said Sudhir Junankar, associate director of economic analysis at the CBI. ""With profitability set to grow faster over the next six months, the upturn in the commercial property market is becoming more firmly based,"" he added. The six-monthly survey, which canvassed 645 private sector firms across the range of sectors and regions in Britain, found 32 percent of companies expect to increase property holdings, 26 percent see a reduction and 41 percent do not envisage a change. ""We expect a steady improvement rather than a dramatic surge in property requirements. The net balance on this survey is plus six percent over the next six months,"" Stuart Morley, Grimley's head of research, said at a briefing on the survey. This, he said was the highest result of the five surveys so far. The report singled out the distribution, metal manufacturing and chemical processing, transport and communications sectors as those likely to see the largest increases in property holdings while over the last six months the largest increases have been in the retail sector. Larger companies are most likely to increase their property holdings, reversing a declining trend over the last six months. This, said Morley, could mark the end of the large-scale restructurings which such companies have been undergoing. ""Large companies have gone through a period of restructuring. This suggests that period has come to an end. They are now looking to expand their holdings,"" he said. Morley said companies were also ""noticeably more optimistic about employment prospects than they were in previous surveys"", adding this was ""now feeding through into increased property demand"", and rents were rising fastest in the retail sector. Retail was most active in terms of change of holdings and the survey said this should continue. ""Not only did this sector see the largest net increase in property holdings over the past six months, it is also expecting the largest net increase."" Areas where growth in demand for property is expected to be greatest are the north west of the country, followed by Northern Ireland, Greater London and Scotland while holdings are expected to fall at a greater rate in the south east, Town centres, with government encouragement, have become more attractive with 50 percent of the extra retail space in these areas rather than out-of-town. ""This shows a gradual realisation that government policies are beginning to bite, a gradual realisation of the encouragement towards town centres where more companies will be looking for space,"" Morley said. Demand for office space is particularly strong in town centres, although the largest companies are still seeking out-of-town floorspace. According to the survey the main reason for companies to spend capital on property over the next six months ""is the need to expand capacity"" ahead of spending to replace property or to increase efficiency. The main constraints companies see to capital expenditure on property are inadequate net returns, difficulty in disposing of property and a shortage of suitable property, the survey found.

"Hunting so-called ""fat cats"" - the biggest company boardroom earners - may have become a British media obsession but the pay packets of the country's top players are under even closer scrutiny from institutional shareholders. The latest row, between electronics giant General Electric Co and some of its major shareholders who objected to a 10 million pound ($15.61 million) five-year package for new managing director George Simpson, resulted in GEC setting tougher performance targets. But questions remain over how much the individuals charged with running some of Britain's most, and in some cases least, successful companies deserve to be paid and have led to a reappraisal of the fundamentals of corporate governance. Both last year's Greenbury committee on executive pay and the earlier Cadbury report on corporate governance laid down guidelines on how companies should behave. But not all the rules are compulsory and some firms have opted not to toe the line. This has led to a more active approach by leading institutional shareholders like Norwich Union and has seen greater involvement from bodies such as the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension funds. ""Institutional shareholders are paying a lot more attention to these issues, not perhaps out of choice but because of circumstances. We do think remuneration issues are important but perhaps get more publicity than they should,"" Anita Skipper, corporate governance manager at Norwich Union told Reuters. Skipper said the group, which has been looking at corporate governance issues for more than a decade, does not generally give a view on the general package an executive receives, but tries to ensure a company's performance justifies the benefit. This means close scrutiny of every aspect of the company's performance, including factors such as its return on capital, cashflow, the way it is managed and its prospects. ""It's good to see the big investing institutions flexing their muscles and taking an active interest in this way,"" one industry insider told Reuters. Last week Tim Melville-Ross, director general of the Institute of Directors, rallied behind Simpson, arguing that very few people were capable of doing the job. Melville-Ross also sat on the Greenbury panel which urged the remuneration committees - which decide directors' salaries - to take into account the wider scene, including pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the company and industry. A row over a new executive bonus scheme at British power and water giant United Utilities in July fuelled public outrage at the million-pound packages that executive directors of monopoly utilities have managed to amass since privatisation. Last year, chairman of Marks and Spencer Sir Richard Greenbury was given the job of attempting to impose curbs following public outrage over the pay of Cedric Brown, formerly the chief executive of British Gas. ""That was a watershed. That was what raised public awareness of the issue (of directors' pay),"" Norwich Union's Skipper said. The Greenbury committee said a number of privatised water and energy companies ""have developed, perhaps unintentionally, remuneration packages which are richer than required to recruit, retain and motivate quality managers"". Skipper maintains that revealing directors' pay is a requirement of good corporate governance. ""It should be there for shareholder scrutiny,"" she said. But her view is not appreciated by all directors. One director of a quoted financial institution, recently told Reuters he was firmly against having his salary and pension details published not least because of the potential personal repurcussions. His mother-in-law happens to be a shareholder and receives the company's annual report and accounts and he confided that she has since hinted she will re-write her will in favour of her other children.

"After several shaky starts, Britain's commercial property market looks set to build on some improvement during 1996, but property experts stress there will not be a return to the sort of boom seen during the 1980s. ""This is the ""Real Thing'. That is the growing opinion among investors when they consider the recovery now underway in the UK real estate market,"" said David Hutchings of property consultants Healey &amp; Baker in his 1997 outlook. Hutchings predicts real rental growth of three percent in 1997 and possible total returns of 15-17 percent for institutional quality portfolios. This should outstrip the return on gilts and may surpass equity returns too, he adds. But uncertainty ahead of a general election, which must be held by the end of May, means a ""gradual but sustained upturn"" is more likely than a market boom, he said. Improved signs of demand, particularly for office space in central London and retail developments, especially shopping centres, have raised expectations. ""The feeling is generally that this year is going to be a good one,"" a senior property analyst at another leading firm of advisors told Reuters. This view is supported by a recent survey by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and property consultants Grimley which was also cautiously bullish. It found increased business confidence meant a third of British firms expect to raise property holdings over the next six months. The six-monthly survey, which canvassed 645 private sector firms across the range of sectors and regions in Britain, found 32 percent of companies expect to increase property holdings, 26 percent see a reduction and 41 envisage no change. NO DRAMATIC SURGE IN DEMAND ""We expect a steady improvement rather than a dramatic surge in property requirements. The net balance on this survey is plus six percent over the next six months,"" Stuart Morley, Grimley's head of research, said last week. Sudhir Junankar of the CBI said firms expect a further pick-up in business, led by domestic demand. ""With profitability set to grow faster over the next six months, the upturn in the commercial property market is becoming more firmly based."" The CBI/Grimley survey predicts such growth will be strongest in the northwest of England, followed by Northern Ireland, Greater London and Scotland. Larger companies are expected to lead the charge with those involved in distribution, transport and communications citing expanding capacity as the main spur in giving the go-ahead to capital expenditure on property. The survey found smaller firms, as well as those involved in metal manufacturing, chemical processing, finance and business services, said that increasing efficiency was the main factor influencing plans for investment in property. INTERESTED INVESTORS But companies seeking additional or new space are not the only ones likely to fuel demand for real estate during 1997. Hutchings said the recovery underway in the property market is supported by both occupational and investment demand, in contrast to a brief upsurge during 1993. Property consultant Knight Frank predicts that prime investment yields will be little changed in December from their levels in December 1996. It forecasts the yield on City of London offices will be unchanged at 5.5 percent, while yields on offices in the area around London's M25 motorway and provincial towns will rise from 6.25 percent to 6.5 percent and from 6.5 percent to 7.0 percent respectively. In addition to offices, investors and property companies are particularly keen on shopping centres. ""The prospects for the retail sector are good,"" the second analyst said. Hutchings also forsees higher rents during the year ahead, fuelled by a growing economy, a shortage of top quality supply and low interest rates. Although some occupiers will hang back until after the election, occupational demand means rents will rise ""at least until new development comes forward"". Some development has already begun and Hutchings says there are now growing signs ""that institutional funds will re-enter the speculative development market in 1997"" although bank lending for such schemes remains tight. This is not the case for other projects where bank loans are more readily available and competition to lend for quality developments has led to wafer-thin margins being charged by some banks, particularly German lenders. LONDON LEADS THE WAY While the number of cranes over the City of London -- London's traditional financial heartland -- has not mushroomed, development activity has begun to pick up and more can be expected over the next 12 months, market players said. In London one very visible factor is the heated rivalry that has emerged between the City and Docklands, the former docks area to the east of the capital which is home to the Canary Wharf tower, London's tallest building. Firms such as U.S. investment bank Merrill Lynch and Britain's Robert Fleming have still to decide on where to relocate, with others such as Close Brothers and Cazenove also rumoured to be in the hunt. And in the retail sector, last year's sale of former fashion mecca Carnaby Street by Dutch property fund Wereldehave for 90 million pounds ""is a testament to the strength of investors' faith in the London market"", said Hutchings.

"Even if British media and leisure group Pearson decides to sell its interest in merchant banking group Lazards, the bank would not be under immediate threat from larger rivals, banking sources said on Monday. Marjorie Scardino's accession last week as Pearson chief executive has prompted widespread talk that Pearson would sell its 50 percent in Lazard Partners, which owns the three Lazard houses in London, Paris and New York. But a pre-emption agreement in cross-shareholdings between Lazards and Pearson would ensure the partnership has first refusal on its own shares if Pearson decides to sell its stake, thus preventing the family-run merchant bank from falling into the hands of larger and expanding international rivals. ""This (speculation) is prompted by the fact that Pearson has a new chief executive who will obviously want to review things,"" one senior corporate financier told Reuters, adding that the pre-emption agreement meant Lazards ""either stays with Pearson or comes within the Lazard empire fully"". Officials at both Pearson and Lazard Brothers in London declined to comment on talk of a possible sale. Pearson has a 50 percent stake in London's Lazard Brothers and smaller nine percent stakes in Lazard Freres in Paris and New York. Its 50 percent stake in the umbrella group Lazard Partners was negotiated during the 1980s. Analysts suggest Lazards does not fit into Pearson's main information, education and entertainment divisions and is therefore a target for being spun off. But banking sources point out that Lazards has been a profitable venture and not a drain. ""It (Lazards) has not required any capital or management time (from Pearson),"" the senior financier added. Pearson, in its 1995 annual report and accounts, points out that its ""close ties to the three Lazard investment banking houses again proved their worth in 1995"". It highlighted attributable profits of 39.9 million pounds from the group for that year. If Pearson, described by Michel David-Weill -- senior partner of Lazard Freres in Paris -- as a ""great partner"" to Lazards since 1919, decides to sever its ties with the merchant bank, there could also be other complications. The Lazard group, which has successfully specialised in corporate finance advisory work as well as asset mangagment and trading activities, holds 48 million Pearson shares. The Financial Times at the weekend quoted David-Weill as saying Lazards might decide to sell this 360 million pound ($600 million) stake to finance a buy-back of Pearson's holding. The newspaper said David-Weill had said the Lazards holding in Pearson was equivalent in value to Pearson's Lazard stake. Although Lazards's stake has been seen as obstacle to a takeover attempt against Pearson, it might sell its shares on the market but in discussion with the group and ""not to a party which could be hostile"", David-Weill told the paper. While Scardino's role at Pearson has been the subject of close scrutiny since her appointment, Lazards have also been in the news, with suggestions of a power-struggle over who will succeed 64-year-old David-Weill. David-Weill said last week there was no succession crisis at the bank, adding he still had time. Under the bank's statutes, he can remain at the helm for another eight years.

"European privatisations in 1997 could total a record $53 billion, with the telecommunications and utilities sectors expected to dominate activity, U.S. investment bank J.P. Morgan said in a report on Monday. ""Compared with last year, we expect a significantly higher number of IPOs (Initial Public Offerings)...Italy stands out as having the most ambitious (privatisation) programme, at close to $20 billion,"" said Caroline Meroz, one the survey's authors. The report said in the run up to Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), European governments ""may feel under increasing pressure to accelerate...privatisation programmes to place themselves on track to meet the Maastricht three percent deficit criterion"". Proceeds could be used to reduce government's financial debt, although they cannot be taken into account when calculating the deficit. It said proceeds of European privatisations in 1996 totalled a record $43 billion, a 30 percent increase on the previous high in 1994, bringing the total value of the European privatisation programme so far to $230 billion. And the total estimate for the proceeds of privatisations through to the end of the century could total $118 billion, according to the report, which was based on 53 enterprises which governments have confirmed they plan to privatise. Meroz told Reuters that the utility sector had shown the greatest slippage on scheduled privatisations for 1996 with a completion rate of only 20 percent, but that otherwise it had been ""a pretty good year"". This had been fuelled by strong European equity markets which, excluding Britain, rose by 26 percent over the year and also by ""the variety of small innovative deals such as share buy-backs,"" Meroz said. Such buy-backs could, Meroz said, be used by governments to dispose of residual holdings in companies during 1997. The report said the energy sector accounted for a larger than expected portion of offerings while the privatisations of Deutsche Telekom and Italy's ENI ""together accounted for 25 percent of 1996 proceeds"". Demand for future offerings should be well suppored by growing domestic interest and J.P. Morgan forecasts that foreign tranches will be closer to 40 percent than the 50 percent take-up by foreign investors expected in the past. ""The market has been able to absorb a lot of equities. We think the demand is there,"" Meroz said, adding there would be strong retail as well as institutional demand. Some of the major privatisations planned for 1996 which failed to see the light of day were included in the report's 1997 estimates but the rest ""may be cancelled (or possibly postponed to much later years) or may be carried out through alternative methods, such as private sales"". But a lack of mix of new ideas, both in terms of sectors and the countries the privatisations hail from, could have a dampening effect on the market in 1997, with privatised stocks seldom able to offer the upside of consumer recovery.

"British yachtsman Tony Bullimore's survival for four days in the icy Southern Ocean owes much to the high-tech safety equipment available to the modern sailor. This year's London International Boat Show was crammed with gadgets such as the Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB). It costs 700 pounds ($1,176) but proved its worth by showing Bullimore's Australian rescuers where to look for him. Bullimore's ordeal in the upturned hull of his yacht after it capsized in a solo round-the-world race is a far cry from the ""Mediterranean marina"" which was the centrepiece of this year's boat show at Earl's Court in west London. Huge ""Gin Palaces"" abound but the show's organisers were keen to stress ""messing about in boats"" is not only for the rich. The smallest vessel on show, the aptly-named Tadpole, was six foot (two metres) long and costs 297 pounds. Around 800 boats were on display, 20 of them bobbing gently up and down in a giant indoor marina, built specially for the show, an annual event. The 200,000 visitors had to wear slippers over their shoes to protect the polished decks if they wanted to go on board. The British boating sector has a turnover of some two billion pounds and the boats on show were not just for dreaming about. Orders totalling millions of pounds were placed in the first week of the show, which ended on Sunday. TRADITIONAL VERSUS HIGH-TECH EQUIPMENT The halls were full of the paraphernalia of boating, with stands displaying traditional brass clocks and barometers competing with the latest in high-tech satellite navigation equipment. If the latest in pump-action lavatories, the smoothest automatic winches or a machine that turns sea-water into drinking water is what you are after, this was the place to be. Some firms demonstrated state-of-the-art sail materials, whose development owes much to the space programme. Others showed how traditional wooden ""clinker"" boat-building still has a place in the late 20th century. The sunnier side of pleasure cruising was to the fore, but, topically, there were also tales of disaster and endeavour. Among the speakers were a couple who 23 years ago spent four months drifting in the Pacific in a tiny inflatable life-raft. Motor boats such as the sleek Sunseekers, the latest model of which, the Predator, sells for 1.8 million pounds, dominate one area, but most of the floorspace was dedicated to sailing. SAILING REFLECTS BRITISH APPROACH TO THE SEA This, says Tony Beechey, executive chairman of the British Marine Industries Federation, is in keeping with the British approach to the sea and reflects recent Olympic successes. ""Britons have always been more sail-oriented than power, maybe it is something to do with the climate...but we seem to have a stronger sailboat past,"" he told Reuters. John Merricks, who with Ian Walker won a silver medal at the Atlanta Olympics in the 470 dinghy class, says boats need to keep evolving if sailing is to compete with other sports, even if this means his class is dropped after the 2000 games. ""It's harder to draw people into the sport with new outdoor activities competing against it,"" he said. ""We need new, fast, exciting and colourful classes."" Many visitors made a beeline for the 49-er, recently selected as a new Olympic class and one of a new breed of ""skiffs"" --lightning-quick sailing dinghies which appear to fly across the water with both helmsman and crew suspended from trapezes. They may cost just over 10,000 pounds, but Martin Wadhams of LDC Racing Sailboats which produces the space-age looking dinghy says fitness, skill and the agility of crews are what counts. ""The major thing about the boat is it brings the true spirit of the Olympics. It is going to spawn a new era in sailing."" ($1=.5950 Pound) ",AlexanderSmith
"Beijing's top negotiator with rival Taipei sought on Tuesday to allay Taiwan's fears that China would swallow up the island if Taipei lifts a decades-old ban on direct trade and transport links between the two. ""We feel this kind of strange logic is very ridiculous,"" Tang Shubei, vice-chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, said of Taiwan's concerns. ""We advocate that after reunification, 'you don't eat me up and I don't eat you up',"" he told reporters in his Beijing office. Taiwan has banned direct air and shipping links with China since Chiang Kai-shek's nationalist troops lost the civil war to Mao Zedong's communist army in 1949 and fled into exile in Taiwan. Taiwan allows indirect links through Hong Kong or third countries. Taiwanese businessmen have poured more than $20 billion into China. Many of them have been clamouring for direct transport links, but Taiwan authorities are reluctant to lift the ban lest the island become an economic hostage to China. Tang said scrapping the ban would help both sides and said Taiwan's losses would be greater than China's in the long run if it resisted direct links. China unilaterally introduced a series of regulations in August to pave the way for direct shipping links with Taiwan. China first called on Taiwan to lift the ban 17 years ago. The ban would in effect be scrapped in mid-1997 in any case when the British colony of Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule, Tang said, adding that Taiwanese aircraft and ships could continue to land and dock in Hong Kong. He said the reunification of China and Taiwan would become a more glaring issue after the nearby Portuguese enclave of Macau reverts to Chinese rule in 1999. ""The Taiwan problem will stand out in front of us after Hong Kong's return in 1997 and Macau's return in 1999,"" Tang said. Tang said time and patience were needed for China and Taiwan to reunify, but declined to spell out a timetable. ""Time is needed to resolve the Taiwan problem. We have adequate patience,"" he said, but urged Taiwan not to seek to declare independence. Beijing has threatened to invade if Taiwan declared independence. He renewed an offer to hold political talks to end almost five decades of animosity. ""Political differences must be resolved (through) political talks,"" Tang said. But Tang said Taiwan must first abandon its attempt to break out of diplomatic isolation. Beijing regards Taiwan as a rebel province and has sought to push the island into isolation. Ties between Beijing and Taipei plunged after the landmark, private visit by Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui to the United States in June 1995 that China saw as a move to raise the island's international profile. China's military conducted missile tests and war games off Taiwan before the island's first direct presidential elections last March, which Lee won by a landslide. Last week, China accused Taiwan of standing in the way of reunification by creating obstacles to economic and trade cooperation, saying the island was ""squashing its own feet with a rock"" by refusing to end the ban.

"China said on Wednesday Japan was heading for confrontation with an election platform reiterating Tokyo's claim to disputed islands in the East China Sea but said it was not too late for Japan to stop its reckless gamble. ""Japan is turning a deaf ear to warnings and protests from China...and has embarked on the road to confrontation,"" the official China Daily said, commenting on the election platform of Japan's biggest political party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). ""It is still not too late for Japan to stop this reckless gamble,"" the newspaper said in a commentary. ""It is high time for Japan to take measures to stop the game for the sake of the world and its own future."" The LDP announced last week an election platform that reiterates Tokyo's claim to the East China Sea islands, which Tokyo calls the Senkakus and which Beijing and Taipei call the Diaoyus. ""Japan has not learnt the lesson of its militarist expansion and...it is going into another dangerous game,"" the newspaper said. On Monday, about 300 Taiwanese and Hong Kong protesters aboard a 50-boat flotilla pierced a Japanese maritime cordon around the islands and briefly raised the flags of Beijing and Taipei on the rocky outcrops in a challenge to Tokyo's claim of sovereignty. Japan has sought to calm passions in the dispute and asked China and Japan to prevent a recurrence of Monday's landings. Tokyo has said it would not recognise a lighthouse built on one of the islands by Japanese rightwingers this year. Japanese rightwingers sailed to the islands in July and repaired the lighthouse, rekindling the dispute. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang on Tuesday accused Japan of taking an irresponsibile approach by encouraging landings on the islands by the rightwing groups. Shen warned that the will of the Chinese people ""cannot be bullied"" and that sovereignty ranked above everything else. The row was aggravated last week when a Hong Kong activist drowned after diving into stormy seas near the islands as part of a protest against Tokyo's sovereignty claim. Tokyo's claim dates back to 1895, when it defeated imperial China and seized the uninhabited islands. Japan says the issue is not open for discussion. China has claimed sovereignty over the islands for centuries. Taiwan has no diplomatic ties with Japan, which only recognises Beijing's Communist government. The China Daily commentary also slammed the LDP's election platform for containing an endorsement of visits by cabinet ministers to a Tokyo shrine to Japan's war dead. ""Japanese politicians have waged a war to reverse the verdict on Japan's war shame concluded by the world half a century ago,"" the commentary said. Japanese prime minister and LDP leader Ryutaro Hashimoto in July broke a decade-long taboo on prime ministerial visits to Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine, saying it was time for Japan to stop apologising for honouring its fallen soldiers. ""Such dishonest activities, which reinvigorate militarism, have naturally caused indignation in the war-victimised countries,"" the newspaper commentary said in reference to visits to the shrine by Japanese leaders. Last week, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang expressed strong indignation over the LDP's election platform. ",BenjaminKangLim
"China's propaganda tsars have axed all the novels and two films of controversial writer Wang Shuo, among the earliest victims of a crusade to resurrect communist puritanism. The state-owned Hua Yi publishing house decided recently to stop publishing a four-volume collection of Wang's 30-odd novels after coming under fire from the Propaganda Department of the ruling Communist Party, the author said on Friday. ""Someone reported me to the Propaganda Department. They said my works were reactionary...and ridiculed politics,"" Wang told Reuters by telephone. ""They said the taste and the language were vulgar...I do not deny this,"" said Wang, the author of colloquial novels that depict the underbelly of society in Chinese cities and are peppered with strong language and sex. Propaganda tsars forced Hua Yi to write a self-criticism for publishing such politically incorrect books, Wang said. ""Hua Yi dared not continue publishing my books...No other publication house will dare to publish them,"" he said. ""The decision is very regrettable...I hope this is temporary...Not all my books have problems. I hope they will allow publication of some of them."" The publishing house and the Propaganda Department could not be reached for comment. Hua Yi has published about 200,000 copies of the ""Collected Works of Wang Shuo"" since 1992. Wang earns more than 100,000 yuan ($12,000) a year from reprints of his works, about 20 times the average urban salary. ""Reprints each year are my major source of income. It will have a big impact on me,"" Wang said of the ban. The publisher has not been required to recall Wang's books, but military-owned bookstores have been banned from selling them. Pirated copies of Wang's works, such as ""I'm Your Father"" and ""Life Fast, Die Happy"", have reportedly now appeared. Wang is the most prominent victim so far of the Communist Party's crusade to resurrect what it calls spiritual civilisation, communist jargon for toeing the party line that has been eroded by nearly two decades of economic reforms. The Communist Party elite ended a four-day, annual closed-door plenum in Beijing on Thursday with a pledge to ""use outstanding works that inspire people to cultivate citizens of a socialist (society) with ideals, morals, culture and discipline"". Chinese film censors have been dragging their feet on giving approval to the public showing of the movie ""Dad"", said Wang, who directed and wrote the script for the film and wrote the extremely popular television series ""Stories from the Newsroom"". ""Basically, it's done for,"" Wang said of his movie, which was completed late last year. A private film company spent 3.3 million yuan ($398,000) on the film. Shooting of ""Relations between Man and Woman"" was halted in April because the movie had ""mistakes and too much description of sex"", said Wang, who wrote the script. The spiritual civilisation campaign has left Chinese filmmakers at a loss and the number of movies shot so far this year has plunged to about 30 compared with an annual average of 160 in the past, a Chinese source said. Eight movies shot by the state-owned Beijing Film Studio had met the same fate as Wang's films, the source said. ""People don't know what kind of movies can be approved,"" said the source who asked not to be identified. Asked if he was repentant, Wang said: ""I only have two roads to take. The first is to change my style and write things the government can tolerate and encourage. The second is to do nothing. ""It's very hard to write things the government likes...I will need two to three years to adjust,"" he said. ",BenjaminKangLim
"China's Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin appears to be making all the right moves to shore up his position to retain power after the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, diplomats and analysts said on Friday. Jiang has declared war on corruption, crime and poverty -- scourges that have plagued China for centuries and led to the downfall of many a dynasty. In his latest move, he used the party's four-day, annual closed-door plenum that ended in Beijing on Thursday to resurrect ideological puritanism -- spiritual civilisation -- which has been eroded by nearly two decades of economic reforms. Whether Jiang would be able to stave off challenges from rivals in the party and cling to power in the post-Deng era hinged in part on the crucial 15th party congress to be held in late 1997, diplomats and analysts said. The party's political heavyweights will be jockeying for position in the run-up to next year's congress, a five-yearly opportunity for reshuffles in the party's powerful Politburo and its yet more influential standing committee. Chinese sources say the Communist Party is debating a plan to revive the post of chairman and to create one or two vice chairman positions -- one of which could be given to Premier Li Peng, a loose ally of Jiang whose term ends in 1998. Li is required by the constitution to step down as premier in 1998 after serving two six-year terms and is keen to find another job to remain in the top echelons of power. Armed with the weapon of spiritual civilisation -- communist jargon for toeing the party line -- Jiang is battling to avoid the fate of his two predecessors, analysts said. Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang were sacked from the party's general secretary post in 1987 and 1989 respectively because their ""grip on material civilisation was tight but their grip on spiritual civilisation was loose"", one Chinese analyst said. ""They did not pay enough attention to ensuring that the party's position could not be challenged...that was what brought them down,"" an Asian diplomat said of Hu and Zhao. A plenum communique attested to Jiang's worries. ""From the start to the end, we should be resolute on tightening the grip on both,"" the plenum communique said. ""At no time can we sacrifice spiritual values in the name of momentary economic development,"" the communique said. The spiritual civilisation campaign aims to create a communist utopia -- stamp out superstition, tighten the party's grip on media, instil politically correct values and create heroes and model workers whose orthodox Marxist behaviour the populace at large should strive to emulate. It is hardly rousing stuff. But Jiang may be desperate. Analysts said Jiang remained overshadowed by Deng, architect of the market-oriented economic reforms and still influential even without an official post and despite increasingly fragile health. ""In the midst of his great triumph, Jiang Zemin if he is all that powerful...there is no need for him to go out of his way to mention Deng Xiaoping,"" a Western diplomat said referring to the communique that tips its hat to Deng. ""Jiang Zemin...is still in consolidation mode...in the process of selling himself,"" he said. ""The jury is still out."" Jiang is eager to consolidate his power base even after amassing the three most important positions in China -- general secretary of the Communist Party, state president and chairman of party's powerful Central Military Commission. Many diplomats see Jiang as a transitional figure after the death of Deng, which is widely expected to trigger a scramble for power among those eager to succeed him as the de facto emperor of the world's most populous nation.

"The mother of detained Chinese dissident Wang Dan said on Monday she would defend her son against the capital charge of plotting to overthrow the government and that he was prepared for a heavy sentence. ""Two defence counsels are allowed...I will be one of them,"" Wang Lingyun, a 61-year-old researcher at a museum who has no background in law, told Reuters in an interview. ""Wang Dan also wants me to defend him,"" she said. Chinese laws allow accused to be defended by family members. A court spokeswoman confirmed Wang Dan, 26, had been charged with plotting to overthrow the government but declined to give further details. Wang Dan's mother said the court had yet to inform her of the trial date, but said it could come as early as this week. The dissident, detained without charge since May 1995, met his mother for the first time under police surveillance at a detention centre in Beijing, the Hong Kong-based Information Centre of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said. ""Wang Dan...was very calm and psychologically prepared for a heavy sentence,"" the group quoted the mother as saying. She added that she was worried about her son's health. She told Reuters earlier that she would defend her son against the charge of collaborating with overseas subversive forces. ""This charge does not stand up,"" she said, adding that Wang Dan had only taken a correspondence course at the University of California, Berkeley, in the United States. ""It has nothing to do with politics. I was the one who wanted him to attend the course...It has nothing to do with overthrowing the government,"" she said. Asked to comment on the chances of winning the case, she said: ""I'm not optimistic. But I must say it for the record. This will become history."" Relatives said last week they had found a lawyer willing to defend Wang after being given one day to find one. The lawyer retained by the family would defend the dissident against other charges in the indictment. Wang Dan, former leader of the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations, has been charged with the capital offence of plotting to subvert the government, based on evidence such as writings critical of the state and accepting funds from abroad. He was detained by police in a raid on his home in May 1995, but was not formally arrested or charged until last week. On Friday, the family obtained a copy of the bill of indictment, which accused Wang Dan of plotting to subvert the government, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of death. The minimum sentence is 10 years, although the court can show leniency if it finds extenuating circumstances. Wang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in the 1989 demonstrations centred in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, which were crushed by the army with heavy loss of life. Wang had been expected to face new charges since last December, when the court that convicted veteran democracy activist Wei Jingsheng of plotting to overthrow the government also implicated the former student leader. The court's verdict said Wei, who was jailed for 14 years, had links with people ""convicted of counter-revolutionary crimes, including Wang Dan"". It also referred to a tape-recorded conversation between Wang and Wei, but gave no details. Wang had been active since his release from jail, defying persistent police surveillance and harassment to join in a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of all those still in prison for their part in the 1989 protests.

"The trial of prominent Chinese dissident and former student leader Wang Dan for the capital charge of plotting to overthrow the government is expected to be held behind closed doors soon, a family member said on Tuesday. The Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court had yet to inform Wang's family of the trial date, the relative said. The court was widely expected to fill the limited number of courtroom seats with carefully selected people to keep away foreign reporters and fellow dissidents. ""Only the people notified by the court can attend the trial. Others cannot attend,"" the family member said in a telephone interview. ""In reality, the trial will not be open...but the court will not admit it is not an open trial,"" the relative said. ""It tells a group of people to attend and calls this an open trial."" A court official, contacted by telephone, declined to comment. If last year's trial of Wei Jingsheng, father of China's tiny, struggling democracy movement, was an indication, Wang's trial would be kept from public view, a political activist said. Dissidents and foreign reporters were barred from Wei's trial. Court officials have confirmed that Wang, detained since May 1995, has been charged with plotting to overthrow the government -- a crime that carries a maximum penalty of death and a minimum of 10 years in prison. They have not given further details of the trial though one official said that Wang could appeal to the Higher People's Court if convicted. Relatives said last week they had found a lawyer willing to defend Wang after being given one day to find one. Wang's mother, Wang Lingyun, a 61-year-old museum researcher who has no background in law, has said she would defend her son in court. Chinese law allows an accused to be defended by a family member. It also states that only lawyers can meet detained defendants. Wang's mother was allowed to meet the dissident at a detention centre in Beijing on Monday because she was his legal counsel. The dissident was mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, Wang's mother told a Hong Kong-based group that monitors human rights in China. ""Wang Dan said he has not done anything wrong...He is very calm...and psychologically prepared for a heavy sentence,"" the group quoted the mother as saying. ""She is very worried about his health,"" the group said. It added that Wang had back, throat and prostate problems. ""In the condition that Wang Dan is in, it would be difficult for him to hold out under another long prison sentence,"" it quoted the mother as saying.

"China's flamboyant tycoon Mou Qizhong is hounded by creditors, faces lawsuits and investigation for alleged irregularities and cannot leave the country, company officials said. The embattled chairman of the Land Economic Group, who has been identified by local media as China's second richest man, was down but not out and was counting on Russian-made satellites to bail him out of financial trouble, they said. ""We're in a crisis,"" Chen Fang, spokeswoman for Mou, told Reuters late on Monday. Mou declined repeated requests for an interview. Domestic creditors had demanded repayment of loans, group officials said. Mou's Land Economic Group owes 200 million yuan ($24.1 million) at home and another 200 million yuan in Hong Kong and Russia. ""Some creditors...have asked for their money back even before the maturity date,"" Chen said, adding that the company was planning to repay the loans gradually. Domestic banks had refused to grant Mou new loans and the group had given up seeking loans from Chinese banks. ""Abruptly recalling loans could be fatal,"" Chen said in an interview. At least one investor had demanded its money back, but agreed to convert its equity into a loan, company officials said. ""The major problem we're facing now is circulating funds getting cut off... As a result, many projects are held up,"" Chen said. Government authorities had cleared Mou of suspicion of tax evasion and of using unlawful funds but he remained under investigation for other unspecified irregularities, company officials said. The authorities had been dragging their feet on renewing his passport apparently out of fear that he may flee the country and join his wife and three sons in the United States. Mou hopes to visit the United States next month. Salaries of employees were slashed to 270 yuan a month -- China's urban minimum wage -- in July and August and were 600 yuan in September from an average of 2,000 yuan a month in the past, the officials said. About 50 people have resigned, leaving some 300. A contractor in Inner Mongolia had sued the Land Group for allegedly defaulting on a contract, and court officials foreclosed on company cars and office equipment in August. ""Many people say that this could be what is called in Buddhism an inexorable doom for Mr Mou or the Land Group,"" Chen said. Chen blamed the woes of Mou on the media ""surrounding and attacking"" him since March as well as a smear campaign by former employees and a government credit squeeze to curb inflation. ""But the Land Group will not collapse,"" she said. Mou plans to raise an unspecified amount of money through a planned share issue, for two Russian-made GALS communications satellites he owns, on the Hong Kong stock exchange, officials said. The first was launched in January 1994 and the second in November 1995. Russia launched both satellites in Kazakhstan. In addition, Mou has bought a 30 percent stake in a company that will develop, manufacture and launch two Russian-made Intersputnik communications satellites. The first of the two satellites is due to be launched from Kazakhstan in late 1998. The satellites were expected to bring Mou net profits of $500 million and bail him out of his current crisis, Chen said. The group has assets worth 1.2 billion yuan and liabilities of just 400 million yuan. It is not Mou's first crisis. He was sentenced to death but eluded execution in the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution for criticising chairman Mao Zedong. Mou was released from prison in 1979 and established his company the following year. He was arrested again and jailed for one year on a charge of speculating in the early 1980s. He ran up huge debts in the mid 1980s but managed to bounce back by importing small refrigerators from South Korea at low tariff rates, raking in millions of yuan. ",BenjaminKangLim
"China sent a senior official to attend a reception at the Ukraine embassy on Friday despite a diplomatic rift over a visit to Kiev by Taiwan's vice president Lien Chan. But an apparent guest list mix-up left both sides unsure over who would represent Beijing at the reception, held to mark Ukraine's independence day. Ukraine's ambassador thought Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei would attend, but the Chinese thought it was Vice-Foreign Minister Zhang Deguang. Zhang, however, fell ill and Vice-Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan showed up instead. The confusion followed Taiwan Vice President Lien Chan's three-day trip this week to Ukraine which infuriated Beijing. ""It was a misunderstanding...a mix-up,"" Ukrainian Minister-Counsellor Leonid Leshchenko told Reuters, referring to the guest list. Asked if he saw it as an intentional slap on the wrist, Leshchenko shook his head and said: ""No, no no."" A Chinese Foreign Ministry protocol officer said Tian, the vice-minister that the Ukrainians were expecting, was abroad. Ukrainian diplomats noted that Tang, the vice-minister who attended, was filling in for Tian as the acting first vice-minister and was actually higher in rank than the person who fell ill. Ukraine's Ambassador Anatoly Plyushko emerged from a half-hour chat with Vice-Minister Tang, and said the vice-minister told him that China attached ""great attention to bilateral relations"" and ""hoped to continue to develop"" ties. Plyushko said the vice-minister did not raise the issue of Lien's three-day Kiev visit. ""All Chinese guests...invited came,"" Plyushko said. ""This is evidence...(of) their attitude towards our relations. I'm optimistic."" The atmosphere was less pleasant on Wednesday when the Chinese Foreign Ministry summoned Plyushko to protest against Lien's trip. China regards Taiwan as a rebel province with no right to conduct foreign relations on its own, and has sought to push it into diplomatic isolation since a civil war separated them in 1949. The former Soviet republic of Ukraine recognises China but not Taiwan. In apparent retaliation against Lien's visit, Chinese State Councillor Li Tieying, a member of the powerful Politburo of the ruling Communist Party, has postponed a visit to Ukraine. In Kiev, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko took a shot at Beijing on Thursday, saying China had over-reacted to Lien's visit and calling Beijing's protest ""out of proportion"".

"A son-in-law of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping has resigned as director of the armament department of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), Chinese sources with close ties to the military said on Sunday. Major General He Ping, husband of Deng's youngest daughter Deng Rong, quit the post recently after his hopes for promotion were dashed, one source said. ""He Ping was unhappy... He wanted to become deputy chief of general staff, but the Central Military Commission would only make him assistant chief of general staff initially,"" the source, who requested anonymity, told Reuters. The assistant chief of general staff is one rank below the deputy chief of general staff. Another source said a replacement had been named to succeed He Ping as director of the armament department, which supplies equipment to the three million-strong PLA. The commission's refusal to give Deng's son-in-law the post he wanted was not so much a blow to the first family as it was a boost to the position of Communist Party boss Jiang Zemin. ""It was not so much as a challenge to Deng Xiaoping. Rather, it was a sign that Jiang Zemin is now more powerful,"" the second source said. The first source agreed. ""Jiang Zemin does not have to do everything Deng Xiaoping says,"" the source said of the commission's decision not to promote He Ping to deputy chief of general staff. Jiang, who is chairman of the commission, has moved in recent years to shore up his position by appointing allies to key military positions and shrug off Deng's shadow. Deng, 92, no longer holds any office but remains highly influential. He has not been seen in public since early 1994. The paramount leader vouched for his son-in-law, whose company was alleged to have been involved in the smuggling of the biggest haul of automatic weapons in U.S. history. ""Deng Xiaoping spoke. He said: 'It was not He Ping's fault'... He Ping does not have any more problems,"" the first source said of the arms smuggling scandal. ""It was a trap by the United States,"" the source said of the arms seizure. Many communist officials harbour deep suspicions of the United States and the view that the arms seizure was a U.S. conspiracy to undermine China. China's two top government-run arms merchants, Polytechnologies Ltd and China North Industries Corp (Norinco), have rejected U.S. charges they were involved in the scandal. He Ping is president of Poly Group, which is owned by the PLA's armament department. Poly Group subsidiary Polytechnologies is a joint venture with China's flagship multinational China International Trust and Investment Co and headed by Wang Jun, son of a late vice-president and close associate of Deng. Norinco is a civilian organisation that has no direct relationship with the army but supplies it with arms. In March, U.S. federal agents seized a shipment of 2,000 AK-47 fully automatic machine guns and 4,000 ammunition magazines, with a street value of more than $4 million. U.S. agents arrested at least seven people, including executives of Norinco, in May and charged them with involvement in the ring. The seizure was the culmination of a 16-month investigation of senior officials, based in both the United States and China, of Norinco and Polytechnologies. The suspects had offered to sell much more powerful weapons to undercover agents, including mortars, rocket launchers, machineguns and a surface-to-air missile, U.S. officials have said.

"China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, reported to be in fragile health, was absent from a rally on Tuesday to pay tribute to him and other survivors of the 1934-36 Long March. Deng, 92, one of about 700 surviving veterans of the Red Army who trekked 9,650 km (6,000 miles) across China on foot to flee Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops, did not appear on state television which showed the 45-minute rally live. Deng, who no longer holds any office but is believed to remain highly influential, has not been seen in public since early 1994. His health is a matter of intense speculation in China, Hong Kong and the Asian region because his death is expected to trigger a scramble for power among those eager to succeed him as de facto emperor of the world's most populous nation. The official line is that Deng is in good health for a man of his age. Extensive preparations were made last year for Deng to grace official celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the World War Two victory against Japan, but his scheduled appearance was cancelled at the last minute, Chinese sources said. The Long March rally was seen by some analysts as a show of support for Deng's successor, Communist Party boss and state president Jiang Zemin, who has been eager to shrug off the patriarch's shadow. ""It was staged to show Jiang has the support of military from the old to the present and future generations,"" one Chinese analyst said. Long March survivors, including former state president and Jiang's bitter rival Yang Shangkun, were at the rally. A representative of the three million-strong People's Liberation Army pledged to follow Jiang's leadership. Eight Young Pioneers -- China's version of boy and girl scouts -- recited poems at the rally at the Great Hall of the People in central Beijing adjacent to Tiananmen Square. Wearing his trademark army uniform with no stars or stripes, Jiang urged the ruling Communist Party to inherit the spirit of the Long March. ""The spirit of the Long March...is a strong spiritual force that guarantees our walking from victory to victory,"" Jiang said, reading from a prepared statement. The gruelling Long March slashed the Red Army's numbers to about 7,000 from 100,000, but survivors were hardened and went on to defeat and drive Chiang and his troops into exile in Taiwan at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. ""The road after the revolution is even longer and the work greater and tougher,"" Jiang said. Jiang has declared war on crime, corruption and poverty -- problems plaguing China today -- and embarked on a crusade to resurrect socialist ethics, which have been eroded by almost two decades of economic reforms. He paid little tribute to his mentor, mentioning Deng only twice in his lengthy speech. The People's Daily, mouthpiece of the Communist Party, splashed on its front page a photograph showing portraits of Jiang, Deng and chairman Mao Zedong hanging over a cultural performance on Monday evening to mark the anniversary.

"China on Tuesday slammed Taiwan for failing to crack down on a new opposition party seeking independence for the island and warned that separatism was ""a road to death"". ""Not only do the Taiwan authorities fail to ban the formation of the Taiwan Independence Party, but they also tolerate it,"" a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office under the State Council, or cabinet, said. ""The self-proclaimed anti-independence stand of the Taiwan authorities is a double-faced practice that deceives others as well as themselves,"" the official People's Daily quoted the spokesman as saying. Beijing has regarded Taiwan as a rebel province since Mao Zedong's Red Army defeated and drove Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops into exile in Taiwan at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. A group of Taiwanese activists plan to break away from Taiwan's main opposition party and form the Taiwan Independence Party on December 12. China has threatened to invade if Taiwan declared independence. China conducted missile tests and war games off Taiwan last March in the run-up to the island's first direct presidential elections to cow Taipei into abandoning any dreams of independence. ""Taiwan independence is a road to death that cannot be walked because it is blocked,"" the spokesman said. The spokesman described the party as a ""reactional political organisation"" with the explicit purpose of splitting the motherland. ""The Taiwan authorities should adopt realistic anti-independence action as soon as possible. Compatriots on the two sides are waiting to see,"" the spokesman said. ""The Chinese government and the Chinese people will definitely not sit back idly and do nothing about it,"" the spokesman warned. ""Their scheme will never succeed,"" he said of the new party's drive for independence. Taiwan says it is committed to reunification, but stresses that this cannot be achieved overnight and says China must democratise. Beijing's criticism came a day after Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui blamed China for deadlocked relations between the two. Referring to the Communist authorities, Lee said in a speech on Monday: ""They adopted a hegemonic attitude and stubborn policy toward Taiwan, singlehandedly blocked the development of history and caused the stalemate of cross-Strait relations."" The island maintains an official policy of anti-independence, but has decriminalised advocacy of independence, saying such calls are within the bounds of freedom of speech. Ties between Beijing and Taipei, which began to thaw in the late 1980s, took an icy plunge after a landmark, private visit by Lee to the United States in June 1995. China, which has sought to push Taiwan into diplomatic isolation, saw the trip as a bid to raise the island's international profile. Beijing has stepped up its reunification overture in recent months, calling for political talks to end almost five decades of hostility. China unilaterally introduced a series of regulations last August to pave the way for direct shipping links with Taiwan. Taiwan has banned direct air and shipping links with China since 1949, but allows indirect links through Hong Kong or third countries. Taiwan is reluctant to lift the ban lest the island become an economic hostage to China. ",BenjaminKangLim
"China demanded on Monday that the United States cancel plans to sell Stinger missiles, launchers and other weapons to Taiwan to prevent ""new damage"" to slowly recovering Sino-U.S. relations. ""We ask the U.S. side...to cancel plans to sell missiles to Taiwan to prevent creating new damage to Sino-U.S. relations,"" a Foreign Ministry spokesman told Reuters. Beijing has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province since the end of the civil war in 1949. It opposes the sale of weapons to the island. The United States should take Sino-U.S. relations into account and live up to its promise regarding the sale of weapons to Taiwan, the spokesman said without elaborating. Washington has agreed to reduce weapons sales to Taiwan. Rejecting a similar demand by China on August 15, the U.S. Defence Department notified Congress last Friday of plans to sell Stinger missiles, launchers and other weapons to Taiwan. U.S. officials said the weapons were defensive and the sale would not affect the basic military balance in the region. The Pentagon said Taiwan wanted to buy 1,299 Stinger missiles, 74 guided missile launchers, 74 flight trainer Stinger missiles, 96 jeep-like Humvee vehicles and 500 rounds of .50 calibre ammunition for an estimated $420 million. The principal contractors are the Hughes Missile Systems Co., Boeing Missile and Space Systems Co. and AM General. Such sales must be made through the U.S. Defence Department, not directly by contractors, and Congress must be notified in case it wants to veto the sale. Sino-U.S. ties have see-sawed in recent years over disputes ranging from human rights abuses and widespread copyright piracy in China to alleged nuclear proliferation by Beijing. The ties plunged to new depths over the last year in a row over a landmark trip by Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui to the United States in June 1995. Earlier this month, Beijing warned Washington that a U.S. stopover by Taiwan's Vice-President Lien Chan could cause new damage to slowly recovering ties. However, in a sign that China was eager to prevent Lien's visit from harming slowly warming relations, Beijing refrained from further comment while Lien was in the United States. Ties between Beijing and Washington were set on better footing after a visit to Beijing by U.S. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake in July. The trip laid the groundwork for an exchange of high-level visits later in the year, with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher invited to China in November and Chinese Defence Minister Chi Haotian due to go to Washington before the end of December. An exchange of visits by Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton could go ahead next year, if Clinton wins re-election in November. Chinese officials have said they expect Christopher's visit, his first since a 1994 trip that stumbled badly over human rights, to go smoothly with both sides keen to remove obstacles in their relations. In a separate development that could strain Sino-U.S. ties, the Washington Post reported on Sunday that U.S. intelligence officials had concluded that Pakistan was secretly building a medium-range missile factory near Islamabad using Chinese blueprints and equipment. Asked to comment on the report, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said: ""The report is totally groundless."" ",BenjaminKangLim
"China said on Friday that Taiwan was a pawn and toy of hostile Western forces out to weaken and divide the country and thwart its development. ""Taiwan...acts as a pawn of international anti-Chinese forces, a toy in the hands of others,"" said a front-page commentary in the People's Daily, the ruling Communist Party's official newspaper. The commentary, issued to mark the 25th anniversary of Beijing's ousting of Taipei from the United Nations, accused Taiwan of collaborating with forces hostile towards China to try to regain admission to the world body. ""Some Western forces have ceaselessly played the 'human rights card', 'Tibet card' to limit China's development,"" the commentary said. ""They see the Taiwan issue as one of their trump cards -- an important means of weakening and dividing China,"" it said without naming any countries but implying the United States. In September, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a non-binding resolution supporting Taiwan's efforts to rejoin the United Nations, enraging Beijing. China, which regards Taiwan as a rebel province, maintains that the issue was settled once and for all in 1971 when Taipei was replaced by Beijing at the United Nations. The commentary said countries that have helped Taiwan with its bid to regain admission to the United Nations were shortsighted like ""rats which can only see an inch in front of their eyes"". It urged Taiwan's allies, mainly Central American, African and Caribbean countries, to stop ""foolish activities in the interest of others"". For the fourth consecutive year, China and its supporters blocked moves in the General Assembly in September to consider U.N. membership for wealthy but diplomatically isolated Taiwan. China considers any move to give Taiwan U.N. membership an encroachment on its sovereignty and an interference in its internal affairs. Beijing and Taipei have been diplomatic rivals since Mao Zedong's Red Army defeated Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists and forced them to flee to Taiwan at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. Beijing's communist rulers have sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation to force it into reunification. Almost 160 countries recognise Beijing, while 30 have diplomatic relations with Taiwan. Both communist Beijing and capitalist Taipei agree to reunify one day, albeit on different terms. China has threatened to invade if the island declares independence. The commentary said Taiwan's offer to give $1.0 billion to the United Nations on admission into the world body had become an ""international joke"". It jeered at the argument that Taiwan deserved a seat as it was now democratic and economically prosperous, saying the island was ""deceiving others and itself"". ""No matter what political system Taiwan implemented or what level of economic development it attained...regaining admission to the United Nations would be purely a dream,"" it said.

"A group of foreign legal experts has asked China for permission to observe next week's trial of detained dissident Wang Dan, a human rights group said on Saturday. Wang faces the capital charge of plotting to overthrow the government, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of death and a minimum sentence of 10 years in prison. The legal team consists of French senator Robert Badinter, former U.S. attorneys-general Nicholas Katzenback and Richard Thornburgh and former Canadian solicitor-general Warren Allmand, the New York-based Human Rights Watch said. ""The request ... is in part to see whether the right of Wang Dan to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal ... is respected,"" the human rights group said. Wang, 26, who vanished into detention in May 1995, would plead not guilty at his Beijing Intermediate People's Court trial which opens on Wednesday, family members have said. The human rights group said the chances of China allowing the foreign legal experts to observe the trial were slim. ""Admittance to the courtroom is often denied to ... journalists and other 'outsiders' on grounds that the courtroom is 'too small',"" Human Rights Watch said. Wang's court appearance would likely be held out of the public eye, as was last year's trial of Wei Jingsheng, regarded as the father of China's tiny, struggling democracy movement. Wang's mother, a 61-year old museum researcher who has no background in law, would attend the trial as one of two defence lawyers. His father and a sister have been allowed to sit in. The court has refused to give details of Wang's trial other than the fact that he has been charged with plotting to overthrow the government, but one official has said Wang could appeal to the Higher People's Court if convicted. Wang's mother has said the dissident was calm and mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, though she has said his health has deteriorated during his detention. Human Rights Watch was not optimistic about an acquittal. ""He has not had adequate time to prepare a defence,"" it said in a statement made available to Reuters by facsimile. ""Chinese criminal trials seldom respect the presumption of innocence, and defence lawyers are generally restricted to arguing mitigating circumstances for a reduced sentence,"" the group said. Wang's family have found a lawyer willing to defend the former student leader after being given just one day in which to do so. Wang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life. He had been active after his parole in 1993, defying persistent police surveillance to join in a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of all those still in prison for their part in the 1989 protests. China has in recent months cracked down on its tiny band of remaining dissidents who have not fled into exile or been imprisoned. ",BenjaminKangLim
"Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan is to step down in a long-delayed reshuffle after the downfall of his mentor, the Chinese capital's disgraced Communist Party boss Chen Xitong, sources with close ties to the city government said on Sunday. Li, 58, mayor of Beijing since 1993, would become a vice-minister of labour and could eventually replace Li Boyong, 62, as labour minister, said the sources who asked not to be identified. The two Lis are not related. Li Qiyan's departure was widely expected after one of his vice-mayors came under investigation for economic crimes and committed suicide in April 1995. The suicide shocked the nation and led to the downfall of Li's mentor, Chen Xitong, who has since disappeared from the public eye. Chen resigned as Beijing's Communist Party boss and was later sacked from the Politburo, becoming the most senior official to be ensnared in a corruption scandal since the communists came to power in 1949. Officials say Chen was himself still under investigation for possible wrongdoing. The city government had been virtually paralysed since Chen's disgrace, the sources said. ""After Chen Xitong stepped down, the (city) government lost its credibility ... and could maintain only the most basic operation,"" one source told Reuters. ""It could not embark on huge projects ... It could not do anything."" Li would be replaced by Jia Qinglin, 56, party secretary of the southeastern province of Fujian, the sources said. Jia arrived in Beijing last week to take up his new post as acting mayor, the sources said. Jia is expected to formally become the capital's mayor after his nomination is approved by the Beijing People's Congress. In the run-up to the party's 15th congress next year, Jia could be promoted to Beijing's Communist Party secretary and land a seat in the party's powerful Politburo, they said. The vice-mayor who committed suicide was found to have used his position to amass 116 houses illegally and build himself a villa on the outskirts of the city. He also masterminded a $37 million embezzlement and graft scam, officials have said. Corruption was virtually eliminated in the years after the communists came to power in 1949, but has staged a comeback along with economic reforms in the past 17 years. Communist Party chief and state president Jiang Zemin has declared war on corruption, warning that the scourge was a virus which threatened the party. Courts frequently impose the death penalty in major corruption cases. Earlier this month, prosecutors filed charges of corruption against 30 people, including Zhou Beifang, former head of two publicly listed Hong Kong affiliates of a China steel giant, and two former officials of the Beijing city government. The announcement of the charges against Zhou was among the first against one of China's so-called ""princelings"", the popular sobriquet applied to the children of the ruling party elite, who enjoy wide influence. Zhou, detained in February, 1995, is the son of Zhou Guanwu, former chairman and Communist Party secretary of Beijing's giant Capital Iron and Steel Corporation, also known as Shougang, and among the largest conglomerates in China.

"The mayor of China's capital resigned on Tuesday in a reshuffle that had been expected since the downfall last year of his mentor, disgraced Beijing Communist Party boss Chen Xitong, in a corruption scandal. The Beijing People's Congress had approved the resignation of city mayor Li Qiyan, the official Xinhua news agency said. It did not explain why Li, 58, was stepping down, saying only that he would become secretary of the Labour Ministry's Communist Party committee. Chinese sources have said Li Qiyan could eventually replace Li Boyong as labour minister. The two men have the same surname but are not related. Diplomats and Chinese sources said Li was forced to step down because of his close links to Chen, who resigned as Beijing party boss in April 1995 after his protege, a vice-mayor, came under investigation for economic crimes and committed suicide. ""Li Qiyan had been closely associated with Chen Xitong...and Li Qiyan's departure was inevitable,"" a Western diplomat said. ""When revelations about the extent of corruption in the Beijing government became public, sweeping changes of the Beijing leadership were required but could not be done in one go in the interest of preserving stability,"" the diplomat said. Chinese sources said the city government had been virtually paralysed since Chen's downfall and that authorities had decided they could no longer delay naming a new mayor. Chen was sacked from the party's powerful Politburo in September 1995, the most senior official to be ensnared in a corruption scandal since the communists came to power in 1949. He has since disappeared from public view and has come under investigation for possible wrongdoing. It was not known if Li was under investigation. Xinhua said the Beijing People's Congress, or city council, had approved the appointment of Jia Qinglin, 56, as vice and acting mayor of the nation's capital. The Central Committee of the Communist Party named Jia to the post of vice secretary of Beijing's party committee. Jia had resigned as party secretary of the southeastern province of Fujian and was replaced by Fujian Governor Chen Mingyi, Xinhua said. Fujian Vice-Governor He Guoqiang would replace Chen as the provincial governor, it said. In the run-up to the party's 15th congress next year, Jia could be promoted to chief of the Beijing municipal party committee and even land a seat in the Politburo, Chinese sources have said. Corruption was virtually eliminated in the years after the communists came to power in 1949, but has staged a comeback along with economic reforms in the past 17 years.

"One of China's most prominent dissidents, Wang Dan, will likely receive a harsh sentence for the charge of plotting to overthrow the government, his mother said on Tuesday. Wang would plead not guilty to the capital charge when his trial at the Beijing Intermediate People's Court begins on Wednesday, said the dissident's mother, Wang Lingyun. ""The court...giving my son a harsh sentence even though he is innocent is very likely to happen,"" Wang Lingyun told Reuters. ""I dare not rule it out."" She said court officials told her the verdict could be delivered as early as Wednesday or in two days, adding that family members have been under surveillance in recent weeks. Wang Dan, 26, who vanished into detention in May 1995, faces a minimum of 10 years in prison and a maximum penalty of death for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government. The court has refused to give details of Wang's trial other than that the dissident has been charged with plotting to overthrow the government.

French senator Robert Badinter, former U.S. attorneys general Nicholas Katzenback and Richard Thornburgh, and former Canadian solicitor-general Warren Allmand have also said they want to observe Wang's trial. Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang on Tuesday shrugged off questions from reporters about the status of the requests, saying Wang's trial was China's internal affairs. Beijing has repeatedly come under fire from the West for human rights abuses. It says foreign intervention in China's internal affairs is not welcomed.

"China began the trial of prominent dissident and former student leader Wang Dan on Wednesday on the capital charge of plotting to overthrow the government, a court official said. ""The trial started at 9.00 a.m. (0100 GMT),"" said an official of the Beijing People's Intermediate Court reached by telephone. He declined to give further details. Security was tight around the court building in western Beijing, with dozens of police preventing the public from approaching the building and manning roadblocks to prevent access. The father of the former student leader protested his son's innocence just hours before the start of the proceedings and said the family would not give in to the authorities. ""He is definitely innocent,"" Wang Xianzeng told reporters as he left his home with the dissident's mother, Wang Lingyun, to go to the court. ""It just depends on whether the government wants to convict him or not."" Wang's mother, a 61-year old museum researcher who has no background in law, would attend the trial as one of two defence lawyers. His father and a sister would be allowed to sit in. ""I'm not optimistic about the results,"" Wang Xianzeng said. ""We will definitely appeal... We will not give in. ""Speech can't overthrow the government,"" he said. The court indictment against Wang, 27, includes the charge that his writings in foreign publications were evidence of his plot to try to overthrow the government. He is also accused of accepting foreign funds, of colluding with subversives living overseas and of conspiring with domestic plotters to organise the overthrow of the government. Wang Lingyun said on Tuesday she expected Wang to receive a harsh sentence although he would plead not guilty. The former student leader faces a minimum 10-year sentence and a maximum penalty of death.

"China called on Taiwan on Tuesday to show goodwill by lifting a decades-old ban on direct trade and transport links, saying attempts by the island nation to block such links would be futile. ""Obstructing the three links between the two sides...will be futile...is against the will of the people on both sides,"" a commentary by the Xinhua news agency said of Taiwan's ban on direct trade, transport and mail links with China. ""(We) hope the Taiwan authorities can make a pragmatic, goodwill response,"" said the commentary carried by major newspapers on Tuesday. Last week, China introduced a series of regulations to pave the way for direct shipping links. Taiwan has banned direct trade, transport and mail links with China since Mao Zedong's communist army defeated and drove Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops to the island at the end of a civil war in 1949. Indirect links between the two sides have been allowed since the late 1980s through Hong Kong or a third country. The commentary accused the Taiwan authorities of creating obstacles to direct trade and transport links in recent years, saying this would not be conducive to prospects for peaceful reunification. The commentary did not explain how it would not be conducive. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and has threatened to invade if the island declared independence. It has also sought to push Taipei into diplomatic isolation. Many Taiwanese businessmen, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, clamour for direct trade and transport links, but Taiwan has been reluctant to lift the ban, which it views as its last bargaining chip in talks with the communists. Taiwan says it is committed to reunification but stresses this cannot be achieved overnight. Last week China heaped pressure on Taiwan by offering to hold political talks to end almost five decades of hostility. Nearly 80 prominent Taiwanese business leaders and politicians were scheduled to arrive in Beijing on Tuesday for a a high-profile, 12-day visit, despite reservations voiced by the island's leaders about depending too heavily on China. The visit has aroused attention because the delegation is led by Kao Ching-yuan, a senior member of Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party and vice-chairman of President Enterprises, the island's biggest investor in China. Taiwanese newspapers said Kao would meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin and other senior officials. The trip comes less than two weeks after Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui called for a review of economic policy toward China with the aim of avoiding over dependence on the mainland. The China Times Express newspaper in Taipei said on Sunday that Taiwan's economic planners had drawn up measures -- including contingency plans to restrict Taiwanese investment on the mainland -- if Taiwan-China relations deteriorate. The Taiwanese delegation would be the largest to visit China since easing tensions across the Taiwan Strait began to fray in mid-1995 over a landmark, private visit by Taiwan's President Lee to the United States. In apparent retaliation, China denounced Lee and held intimidatory war games off Taiwan before the island's historic presidential elections in March in which Lee was re-elected. ",BenjaminKangLim
"Chinese dissident Wang Dan has appealed against his 11-year jail sentence for plotting to subvert the government, but his mother said on Tuesday she held little hope of an acquittal or a lighter sentence. Wang Lingyun said she hoped U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and German President Roman Herzog would raise her son's predicament in their meetings with Chinese leaders when they visit China later this month. ""Wang Dan... should be acquitted because... he's innocent,"" she told Reuters by telephone. ""We hope for an acquittal or a reduced sentence... but it is unlikely."" Wang Lingyun, who acted as one of two defence lawyers in her son's case, said court officials had asked her to submit a written defence for the appeal and that family members may not be allowed to attend the appeals court trial. Experts on China's legal system have said the chances of the appeals court overturning the lower court's verdict were slim. An official of the Beijing Higher People's Court said the 27-year-old dissident had filed his appeal. She declined to provide further details. The Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court took less than four hours last Wednesday to convict and sentence Wang, who had already served four years in prison for his role as a leader of the 1989 student demonstrations for democracy that were crushed by the military with heavy loss of life. On Monday, visiting Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson said he had expressed his disapproval to Chinese Premier Li Peng over the jailing of Wang. A foreign ministry spokesman defended China at a news briefing on Tuesday, saying Beijing would not impose its laws on others and that foreign countries should take a similar stance. The spokesman also said China opposed using human rights as a pretext to interfere in the internal affairs of any country. An international human rights group denounced what it said was the ""secret trial"" of Wang on a trumped-up charge. ""What (the court) brought to bear on Wang Dan was a secret trial in which the facts were deliberately hidden and the truth distorted,"" the New York-based Human Rights in China said in a statement made available to Reuters by facsimile. ""A fabricated charge was used to wantonly convict Wang Dan,"" the group said. ""Wang Dan's case... is suppression and persecution of thought and speech by the Chinese government."" When told during the trial of his right to seek the removal of any biased judges, Wang demanded all judges and prosecutors be removed from the case. The tribunal rejected his request after a few minutes of deliberation, the group said. China said it was an open and fair trial but Human Rights in China said no foreign reporters, diplomats or other international observers were allowed to attend. The group said more than 10 people wearing tags identifying themselves as reporters attended the trial but there was no mention of the conviction in the local Chinese-language media. The jailing of Wang was the latest in a series of crushing blows to China's struggling pro-democracy movement. Most dissidents have already been forced into exile or are serving long sentences in prison or labour camps. Human Rights in China accused the official Xinhua news agency of preparing English-language stories about the results of the trial and an interview with the chief judge even before the verdict was delivered. Asked to comment, an official of the foreign affairs office of Xinhua said: ""It is not necessary to find out whether the story was prepared before or after the sentencing... News agencies have different ways and practices of releasing news."" After breaking the news of Wang's conviction, it took Xinhua only 1-1/2 hours to put out a 54-paragraph story on the interview with the chief judge. ",BenjaminKangLim
"Leading Chinese dissident Chen Ziming has been placed under tight police surveillance after his release on medical parole and needs permission to consult a doctor, a relative said on Thursday. ""Some conditions (after his parole) are not as good as when (he) was in prison,"" the dissident's sister, Chen Zihua, said after meeting him earlier on Thursday at his home. ""When he was in prison he could still go downstairs for some air,"" she said in a telephone interview. ""(Now) he can't even go downstairs to get some sun... He cannot go out."" Chen Ziming has been under tight police surveillance since he was released on medical parole and returned to his eighth-floor Beijing home late on Wednesday. Asked about Chen's plans, the sister said he did not talk about anything besides his wish to get medical treatment. The dissident needs police permission to see a doctor, the sister said. He has heart, liver and digestion problems. He had been treated for cancer. He is barred from talking to foreign reporters. Uniformed and plainclothes police on Thursday prevented reporters from approaching Chen's home and that of his parents. Asked if the dissident was under house arrest, Chen's sister said: ""(I'm) afraid it's a little graver than that. It's just moving the prison from one place to another."" But his release was a welcome surprise to the family. ""We felt surprised to a certain degree. Of course, (we) are happy (he) could be released,"" the sister said. ""His medical parole...was a little unexpected."" Chen, 44, was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 1991 for engaging in ""counter-revolutionary"", or subversive, activities during a student-led campaign for democracy that was centred on Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989. Chen had been singled out by Beijing authorities as the ""black hand"" behind-the-scenes organiser of the demonstrations, which were crushed by the army with heavy loss of life. He won medical parole in 1994 in a move widely seen as part of a successful bid by Beijing to persuade Washington not to revoke China's Most Favoured Nation trade status on grounds of persistent human rights violations. Chen was returned to prison on June 25, 1995, after joining calls for Beijing to release political prisoners and reverse its verdict that the Tiananmen Square protests were seditious. His release on Wednesday came seven days after a Beijing court took less than four hours to convict former student leader Wang Dan and sentence him to 11 years in prison for plotting to subvert the government. Wang's imprisonment was the latest in a series of crushing blows to China's embattled dissidents, most of whom were already either in exile or serving long terms in administrative detention or prison. Asked if Chen's release was a gift to U.S. President Bill Clinton on his re-election, the sister said: ""It gives (Clinton) face."" Human rights have long been a major irritant in Sino-U.S. ties already strained by disputes over trade, copyright piracy, arms proliferation and Taiwan. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is scheduled to travel to Beijing this month for a visit widely seen as a vital step toward rebuilding the cross-Pacific relationship. ",BenjaminKangLim
"China announced on Saturday a massive restructuring of one of its biggest conglomerates after reportedly meting out a suspended death sentence to the son of the former company chairman, one of the country's ruling elite. State media announced the restructuring of Capital Iron, or Shougang, on Saturday but made no mention of the suspended death sentence handed down to Zhou Beifang, the former head of two of the steel giant's Hong Kong-listed affiliates. A Beijing court gave Zhou the suspended death sentence for corruption as part of China's highly-publicised anti-graft campaign launched last year, a Chinese source said on Saturday. The sentence was the heaviest handed down in recent years to one of China's so-called ""princelings"", the popular sobriquet applied to the children of the ruling party elite, who enjoy wide influence. Shougang, one of China's biggest conglomerates, was thrust into the limelight after Zhou's detention in February 1995. The arrest of a man symbolising Beijing's efforts to wield capitalist influence while retaining a socialist veneer underlined the vulnerability of that system to nepotism and abuse. Zhou Beifang's father, Zhou Guanwu, 78, resigned as chairman and Communist Party secretary of Shougang in February 1995, citing old age following his son's detention. The Zhous have close ties to the family of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. Last month, prosecutors filed charges of corruption against 30 people, including Zhou Beifang and two former officials of the Beijing city government. No other details of the case were available. Chinese courts frequently impose the death penalty in major corruption cases. Suspended death sentences are often commuted to life imprisonment after two years. Court officials could not be reached for comment on the sentencing. The China Daily said the restructuring of Shougang draws a clear line between the property rights, responsibility and management of the parent company and subsidiary. In the past, a large percentage of the parent company's profits went to branch companies, many of which are running in the red, the newspaper said. Shougang's parent company would gradually cut off financial subsidies to subsidiaries which would be forced to sink or swim in the market economy as part of the restructuring programme. ""We will provide financial support for our subsidiaries for a few years, helping them in investment, finance and discharge of their debts based on an appraisal of their fixed assets,"" Bi Qun, Communist Party secretary of Shougang, told the newspaper. ""Once that is done the subsidiary companies will develop strategies to stop losing money and begin to make profits,"" Bi was quoted as saying. The number of employees of the parent company would be gradually slashed to 58,000, or one-fourth of the group's total, the Xinhua news agency said. It gave no timetable. The group's 27 subsidiaries would employ 176,000 people. The group registered 1.653 billion yuan ($199 million) in pre-tax profits in the first 10 months of 1996, Xinhua said. It gave no comparative figures. Corruption was virtually eliminated in the years after the communists came to power in 1949, but has staged a comeback along with economic reforms in the past 17 years. Communist Party chief and state president Jiang Zemin has declared war on corruption, warning that the scourge was a virus that threatened the party. ",BenjaminKangLim
"Two Chinese magazines are struggling for survival after being targeted in a crusade by China's propaganda tsars to cleanse the media of liberal influences, Chinese sources said. ""Focus"" magazine in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen has suspended publication for two issues after a Hong Kong newspaper reported the magazine defied propaganda tsars and ran a cover story on the anniversary of the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, the sources said. The Propaganda Department of the Communist Party had frowned on any commemoration of the decade of turmoil unleashed by revolutionary leader Mao Zedong to purge political rivals and infuse the nation with renewed ideological vigour. A writer for the magazine said the suspension was due to a Hong Kong newspaper report of the article's publication. ""Had it not been for the foreign report, the magazine would not have suffered this kind of setback,"" said the writers, peaking anonymously ""This was a kind of punishment...by the party."" In a telephone interview, Li Mei, publisher of Focus, disputed this assessment, saying the suspension was linked to unrelated financial trouble. Other Chinese sources said the problems at ""Focus"" stemmed from the Communist Party's clampdown on publications and authors who dare to break away from a stultifying diet of state-approved fare. ""If a publication takes a detour (from the party line), it will be suspended for restructuring. There will be no exceptions,"" one source quoted propaganda tsars as saying. Propaganda tsars are also debating the fate of the Beijing-based magazine ""Orient"" for publishing a series of book reviews on the ""Collected Works of Gu Zhun"", sources said. The Propaganda Department of the ruling Communist Party had ordered a gag on all debate on the thoughts of Gu, an independent thinker who angered Beijing before his death during the Cultural Revolution. Gu openly opposed totalitarianism and supported the rule of law and civil rights. The fifth edition of the magazine was published in September under the watchful eyes of censors, the sources said. ""We will still be able to publish the sixth edition. After that we don't know,"" a magazine editor, who asked not to be named, said in an interview. ""They did not say what exactly the problem was with the magazine,"" said the editor who suggested that politics could be the cause. The axe has fallen on other publications, authors and filmmakers. In August, the Press and Publications Administration suspended publication of the Economic Work Monthly, based in the southwestern province of Guizhou. The suspension followed the magazine's publication of an article critical of a privately circulated tract known as the ""10,000-word essay"" that urges a return to class struggle and warns of the erosion of the state sector by private enterprise. In September, Cui Enqing was sacked as president of the Beijing Youth Daily after the Chinese capital's most outspoken newspaper reported a poisoning case that caused a plunge in sales of a state-owned beverage manufacturer. Propaganda tsars also have banned all of the novels and two films of controversial writer Wang Shuo. The campaign to enforce ideological orthodoxy has left Chinese filmmakers at a loss as to what kind of movies would receive the blessings of propaganda tsars. The number of movies made this year has fallen sharply compared with previous years. ",BenjaminKangLim
"China's former first lady Wang Guangmei auctioned her private antique collection on Tuesday and said she would use proceeds to help impoverished mothers. Wang's collection, consisting of porcelain bowls and plates and a brush holder made of ivory dating back to the Qing (1644-1911) and Song (960-1279) dynasties, fetched 566,000 yuan ($68,000) at an auction at a Beijing hotel. ""My mother gave them to me ... They are priceless to me,"" Wang told Reuters. She is the widow of former president Liu Shaoqi who died in prison during the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. The Sungari auction house had put the value of the antiques, some of which were Wang's dowry from her wealthy capitalist father, at up to 510,000 yuan ($61,000). The collection was seized from Wang and eluded destruction by radical Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution. The authorities returned some of her collection when she was released from prison 11 years later. ""They were at Zhongnanhai or they would have all been smashed during the Cultural Revolution,"" Wang said. The Zhongnanhai compound in central Beijing still serves as home and office to many of China's leaders. Liu, China's former president, was deposed during the Cultural Revolution and died in prison in 1969. He was rehabilitated posthumously in 1980. Wang said she had deep emotional ties to the collection but these were outweighed by concerns for those living in poverty. ""I would be reluctant to part with what my mother left me without a reason ... (but) my heart aches even more when I see impoverished mothers,"" the former first lady said. ""It shouldn't be like this. The country led by our Communist Party cannot let families be this destitute,"" she said. China has about 65 million people still struggling to get by with incomes under the official absolute poverty line of 530 yuan ($64) a year, officials say. In September, Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin vowed to ""gnaw the hard bone"" of poverty by pouring funds into the drive to raise living standards for the poorest segment of the nation by the turn of the century. The communists, who swept to power in 1949 on public resentment against widespread poverty and corruption, fear the widening gap between rich and poor today could spark social unrest and undermine its grip on power. China says it reduced the number of people living in abject poverty by five million in 1995. About 3,500 destitute mothers in western and southwestern China were expected to benefit from Tuesday's auction. Proceeds would go to an anti-poverty fund headed by the former first lady to lend money to impoverished mothers to help them get started in farming, raise livestock or make handicrafts to earn a living in future, Wang said. The fund would also provide education and give medical treatment to destitute mothers, she said. ",BenjaminKangLim
"Taiwanese business leader Kao Ching-yuan on Wednesday urged Beijing to resume talks with Taiwan, saying the island's investors would lose confidence in China if political friction impeded relations. ""If the relations between the two sides are kept at a low ebb due to political and ideological problems... Taiwanese businessmen will lose confidence because of higher risks,"" said Kao, vice-chairman of President Enterprises, Taiwan's biggest investor in China. Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing earlier told the same seminar in Beijing no one could stand in the way of direct trade and transport links between China and Taiwan which have been banned by the island since 1949. Kao is heading a delegation of nearly 80 prominent Taiwanese business leaders and politicians who arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for a high-profile visit. Taiwanese economic officials are visiting in a private capacity. Kao called for the resumption of talks suspended last year after Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui made a landmark trip to the United States. Beijing regards Taiwan as a rebel province and has sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation. ""I would like to suggest here... that the two sides resume as soon as possible talks on trade and investment,"" Kao said. Taiwanese newspapers said Kao would meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin and other senior officials during the current trip, which comes less than two weeks after President Lee called for a review of economic policy toward China with the aim of avoiding overdependence on the mainland. Taipei's China Times Express newspaper said on Sunday that Taiwan's economic planners had drawn up measures -- including contingency plans to restrict Taiwanese investment on the mainland -- if Taiwan-China relations deteriorated. Li, the Chinese vice-premier, took a swipe at President Lee, saying no one could block direct trade and transport links between China and Taiwan, rivals from the time of the Chinese civil war that ended in 1949. ""Economic development between the two sides is the general trend and no single person can obstruct this,"" Li said. ""Any person who tries to place artificial barriers to restrict economic cooperation is going against the will of the people of the two sides,"" he said. He also told the seminar he hoped Taiwan authorities would allow direct links as soon as possible. Indirect links between the two sides have been allowed since the late 1980s, through Hong Kong or a third country. Many Taiwanese businessmen, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, are eager for direct trade and transport links. But Taiwan has been reluctant to lift the ban, which it views as its last bargaining chip in talks with the communists. China has been pressing Taiwan to open direct links. Last week, China introduced a series of regulations to pave the way for direct shipping links. The Taiwanese delegation is the largest to visit China since a trend of easing tensions was reversed by Taiwan President Lee's mid-1995 visit to the United States. ",BenjaminKangLim
"China's exports climbed again in October as slow demand at home encouraged companies to ship abroad and the government expanded credit to exporters, newspapers and a government economist said Wednesday. The upturn was expected to continue through the first half of 1997, said Wang Jian, a researcher with the cabinet's State Planning Commission. Exports rose for the fourth consecutive month in October, jumping 23.3 percent to $15.22 billion from a year ago, said the International Business Daily, a newspaper published by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. The performance helped the nation register its biggest monthly trade surplus of the year. The surplus stood at $3.9 billion in October compared with $3.2 billion in September, the newspaper said. ""This kind of rebound in exports ... is estimated to last until the first half of next year,"" Wang said in a telephone interview. Wang said slow domestic demand has forced manufacturers to look to overseas markets. Also, domestic enterprises had adjusted to a cut in government-paid export tax rebates, he said. The government slashed the rebate on exports of industrial products to 9.0 percent from 14.0 percent on January 1, 1996. The International Business Daily said exports rebounded because the government sped up the payment of export tax rebates and expanded credit to exporters. Exports slumped in the first six months of 1996, dented by rising wages and the relative strength of the currency. A slowdown in government payments of tax rebates to exporters had also discouraged many firms from exporting their goods earlier in the year. Many of those firms focused sales on the domestic market instead. However, the government has been stepping up payment of export rebates to try to revive exports. Imports inched up 3 percent to $11.31 billion in October from October 1995, the Business Daily said. The import data showed that the impact of this year's tariff cuts has gradually weakened, it said. In the first 10 months of this year, China's exports totalled $119.22 billion, mostly unchanged from the same 1995 period, the newspaper said. But imports added up to $107.21 billion, a rise of 5.5 percent from the year-ago period. Japan, the United States and Europe remained China's largest export markets. China's exports to Japan rose a year-on-year 8.6 percent to $24.5 billion in the first 10 months of this year, the daily said. Exports to the United States and Europe increased 5.5 percent and 4.5 percent to $21.3 billion and $18.9 billion respectively. ",BenjaminKangLim
"China has vowed to curb the influence of Buddhism in Tibet, saying religion would have to bow to socialism. Monks outnumbered students and more money was spent on monasteries than on Communist Party buildings in the Himalayan region, the official Tibet Daily said in an edition seen in Beijing on Wednesday. ""In the basic interest of the Tibetan people, further development of temples, monks and nuns cannot be without restrictions,"" the newspaper said. ""Satisfying the basic needs of believers will do."" There were 1,787 temples in the restive region by early 1996, with 46,000 monks and nuns -- exceeding the number of high school students in the region, the newspaper said. It gave no comparative figures. China has shut many temples in Tibet in recent years to uproot the influence of the region's spiritual god-king, the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against communist rule. Socialism must take precedence over religion, the newspaper said. ""Religion must adapt to the development needs of socialism and not socialism adapting to the needs of religion. We must remain clear-headed on this principle,"" it said. The Dalai Lama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaign for autonomy for his homeland, but Beijing views international support for Tibet's holiest man as a Western plot to return the region to feudal rule and split China. Beijing says the Dalai Lama is a political activist and not a purely religious figure. ""International anti-Chinese forces use the Tibet issue to contain China's development and (the Tibet issue) is an important means to 'Westernise' and 'divide' China,"" the newspaper said. ""Some temples are directly or indirectly controlled by the Dalai Lama clique and become the headquarters and venue of separatist forces at home and abroad,"" the newspaper said. ""Since 1987, elements creating disturbances and sabotaging stability have been mainly law-breaking monks and nuns."" Tibet has been rocked by repeated anti-Chinese protests that Beijing charges are stirred up by supporters of the Dalai Lama. The newspaper also complained that monks did not contribute to economic growth. ""It goes without saying that such a large number of strong young people relying on alms from the masses and not engaging in productive work has a negative effect on social and economic development,"" the newspaper said. ""Money spent on renovating temples is more than money spent on building or repairing Communist Party and government buildings,"" it said. Beijing, eager not to antagonise all of the Buddhist clergy, has pumped 53 million yuan ($6.4 million) into its five-year renovation of the sprawling Potala Palace, winter home of the Dalai Lamas for centuries.

"China announced on Thursday that a court had rejected the appeal by a son of one of the country's politically powerful families, upholding a suspended death sentence for bribery. The court showed leniency to Zhou Beifang, 43, former chairman of Hong Kong-listed affiliates of the giant state-owned Capital Iron and Steel Corp (Shougang), because he showed remorse, the official Xinhua news agency said. Zhou's death sentence was suspended for two years. Such suspensions usually mean the sentence will not be carried out if the prisoner repents and cooperates with authorities. Zhou is one of China's so-called ""princelings"", or children of the ruling party elite, who enjoy wide influence due to their top level connections. The Zhou family has close ties to the family of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. The court also showed leniency because Zhou voluntarily returned ill-gotten wealth even before prosecutors obtained evidence against him, Xinhua said. Zhou was convicted of accepting bribes totalling 9.28 million Hong Kong dollars ($1.2 million) between June 1993 and April 1994, Xinhua said. It gave no details of who paid Zhou the bribes or why. He was also found guilty of paying 1.2 million yuan ($144,600) in bribes to three people, including two former officials of the Beijing city government, so that his wife and daughter could move to the British colony, it said. Xinhua quoted the Supreme Court as announcing the decision though it was the appeals court that handed down the verdict. The agency gave no explanation. It did not say when Zhou was convicted, when he appealed or why his appeal was turned down. Court officials reached by telephone declined comment. State television showed a grim Zhou wearing a stylish, striped blue shirt and examining documents held by a court policeman as a court tribunal looked on. Zhou's conviction was part of a highly-publicised anti-graft campaign launched by China last year. It led to the suicide of a Beijing vice-mayor in April 1995 and the fall of his mentor, former Beijing Communist Party boss Chen Xitong. Zhou's father, Zhou Guanwu, 78, resigned as chairman and Communist Party secretary of Shougang in February 1995, citing old age. He stepped down days after his son's detention. The court also rejected the appeal of co-defendant Chen Jian, 39, former deputy director of the General Office of the Communist Party's Beijing Municipal Committee. It upheld his 15-year prison sentence for accepting bribes from Zhou, Xinhua said. Another former official of the Beijing city government, Li Min, did not appeal against his sentence of life imprisonment, also for accepting bribes from Zhou, the agency said. In a related case, the court rejected the appeal of businessman He Shiping, who was sentenced to 16 years for accepting bribes. A fifth defendant, who was given five years in prison, did not appeal, it said. Television showed lengthy footage that include Li staring at the floor and a dejected He Shiping wiping tears from his eyes. Corruption was virtually eliminated in the years after the communists came to power in 1949. But it has staged a comeback since economic reforms were introduced 17 years ago as living standards climb but at the cost of eroding party discipline. ",BenjaminKangLim
"China will defrock radical monks in Tibet in a crackdown that could last up to five years in a bid to uproot the influence of the Dalai Lama in his Himalayan homeland, a Chinese propaganda official said on Thursday. ""Lamas who are comparatively reactionary will be told to return to secular life,"" the propaganda official said by telephone from Tibet's capital, Lhasa. ""Reorganisation of monasteries... will consist mainly of ideological education... It could continue for three to five years,"" said the official, who declined to identify himself. China has vowed to curb the influence of Buddhism and the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled god-king, in the region, saying religion must conform to socialism instead of the other way round. Atheist China views religion as feudal superstition though it tolerates a limited degree of religious freedom. ""Religious culture... not only hampers social development and economic development, but also stops people becoming more civilised,"" the official Tibet Daily said in an edition seen in Beijing on Thursday. The newspaper complained last week that monks in Tibet outnumbered students and more money was spent on monasteries than on Communist Party buildings. ""Monasteries will not be closed... (but) work teams will enter and be stationed at monasteries,"" the propaganda official said. For several months, China has been stationing ""work teams"" in Tibetan monasteries. The teams force monks into study sessions on becoming more ""patriotic"" and into signing pledges supporting Chinese authorities. ""Those aspects of religion which fail to adapt to social development and impede social progress will be eliminated... to prevent the Dalai Lama from using religion to engage in splittist activities,"" the official said. There were 1,787 temples in Tibet by early 1996, with 46,000 monks and nuns -- exceeding the number of high school students in the region, the Tibet Daily has said.

"A Chinese court on Friday will consider the appeal of dissident Wang Dan against his 11-year sentence for plotting to overthrow the government, a hearing held days before a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. The Beijing Higher People's Court was widely expected to reject the 27-year-old dissident's appeal and uphold his conviction, Chinese lawyers said. In China, appellate courts rarely overturn rulings by lower courts. Asked what the chances were of an acquittal, Wang's mother, Wang Lingyun, told Reuters on Thursday: ""I feel there's practically none. There is no precedent."" Wang's appeal comes four days before the scheduled arrival of the U.S. secretary of state, who diplomats say was expected to raise human rights issues in his meetings with Chinese leaders during his November 19-21 visit. Sino-U.S. relations have been strained over the last year by a range of issues from human rights to Taiwan to arms proliferation and trade. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai told a briefing on Thursday that Wang's trial had no bearing on Sino-U.S. relations because it involved a Chinese citizen and not an American. Beijing has slammed Western criticism of its human rights record as interference in its internal affairs. Christopher would not be not alone in bringing up Beijing's shortcomings in human rights. Former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher said on Thursday that harsh sentences slapped on Wang and Wei Jingsheng, widely known as the father of China's modern democracy movement, had caused dismay in the international community. ""The recent harsh sentences imposed on Mr Wei and Mr Wang have caused dismay in the wider world,"" Thatcher told a business conference in Beijing. Last week, Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson said he had expressed his misgivings over the jailing of Wang to his Chinese counterpart, Li Peng. Wang's mother said court officials had told her that she would be able to attend her son's hearing as one of two defence lawyers, but she would not be allowed to speak. She has submitted a written defence. The dissident's father and older sister would also be allowed to sit in on the hearing at the appellate court in Beijing, the mother said. ""If we don't go, Wang Dan would feel even more isolated. Our going is spiritual encouragement for him,"" the mother said. The dissident's lawyer is unlikely to attend because only Wang would be allowed to speak. The jailing of Wang was the latest in a series of crushing blows to China's struggling pro-democracy movement. Most dissidents have already been forced into exile or are serving long sentences in prison or labour camps. The lower court took less than four hours to convict and sentence Wang on October 30. Wang had already served four years in prison for his role as a leader of student demonstrations for democracy that were crushed by the military with heavy loss of life in 1989. The New York-based Human Rights in China has denounced what it said was the ""secret trial"" of Wang on a trumped up charge. China said it was an open and fair trial but Human Rights in China said no foreign reporters, diplomats or other international observers were allowed to attend. There has been no mention of Wang's conviction in the local Chinese-language media. ",BenjaminKangLim

The mother said she would petition the appeals court but that it would be a formality and would not involve the court holding another trial. Court officials, reached by telephone, declined comment. The tightly-controlled state media made no mention of Wang's conviction. Police earlier kept reporters away from the court building, the family's home and nearby subway stations. The dissident, wearing a red sweater and grey suit, appeared in low spirits and poor health, the mother said. ""(But) he was psychologically prepared. It came as no surprise. He does not have any illusions about them (the authorities),"" she said. The former student leader had already served four years in prison for his role in student demonstrations for democracy that were crushed by the army in 1989. The U.S. secretary of state, scheduled to arrive on Tuesday, was likely to bring up human rights when he meets Chinese leaders. Sino-U.S. relations have been strained over the last year by issues ranging from human rights to Taiwan to arms proliferation and trade. Beijing has slammed Western criticism of its human rights record as interference in its internal affairs. Former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher said in Beijing on Thursday that the world was dismayed by harsh sentences slapped on Wang and fellow dissident Wei Jingsheng, the father of China's modern democracy movement. The jailing of Wang was the latest in a series of crushing blows to China's struggling democracy movement. Most dissidents have already been forced into exile or are serving long sentences in prison or labour camps. China has said Wang's trial last month by a lower court was open and fair but the New York-based Human Rights in China said no foreign reporters, diplomats or other international observers were allowed to attend. Human Rights in China has denounced the trial as a ""secret trial"" on a trumped up charge. The lower court took less than four hours to convict and sentence Wang on October 30. ",BenjaminKangLim
"American movies, hamburgers, jeans -- and U.S. bashing -- are all the rage in China today. China and the United States have gone from confrontation in the 1950s and 1960s to odd bedfellows in the 1970s and 1980s to a love-hate relationship in the 1990s. ""More and more ordinary Chinese people are disgusted with the deeds of the United States,"" said Tang Zhenyu, one of five authors of ""China Can Say No"", a controversial bestseller which is capitalising on anti-U.S. sentiment. For Tang, the fondness he once had for the United States ended in March when Washington sent aircraft carrier battle groups to waters near Taiwan where China was conducting war games and missile tests to cow the island into abandoning any dreams of independence. ""I believe this was the turning point for most ordinary Chinese people,"" Tang said in a recent interview. Washington sent the warships in a show of force to support Taipei, Beijing's rival since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, as Taiwan held historic direct presidential elections. For some Chinese, their American dream turned into a nightmare when Beijing lost its bid to host the 2000 Olympics in 1993. Many blamed Uncle Sam. Anti-U.S. sentiment mounted after Chinese state media played up what was described as unfair and discriminatory treatment meted out to Chinese Olympians at the Atlanta Games. ""In the past, the United States had the wrong impression that the Chinese government was anti-U.S. while the people were pro-U.S.,"" said Wang Jisi, director of the Institute of American Studies of the prestigious Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ""China Can Say No"" touched a sympathetic chord with many Chinese fed up with the United States. It has chapters entitled ""Burn Hollywood"" and ""If necessary, create another Saddam"" in a reference to Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein. ""China Can Say No"" sold so well that its authors have put out a sequel. It has given rise to a flurry of anti-U.S. books, including ""Why Does China Say No?"" Beijing and Washington have also wrangled over human rights, arms proliferation and trade. The two giants narrowly avoided a bruising trade war in 1995 and again this year over U.S. charges that China condoned copyright piracy. Many Chinese welcomed the re-election of U.S. President Bill Clinton this month as the return of a devil they knew and are hoping for a new post-election approach from Washington. ""Now, a good opportunity has presented itself for improving and expanding Sino-U.S. relations,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai said of Clinton's re-election. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is scheduled to visit China next week to help push that process along. China last week blasted U.S. penalties against textiles ahead of Christopher's visit, but said the two sides had more in common than differences. The Sino-U.S. honeymoon began in the 1970s when China's bamboo curtain came down and the country opened up to the West, triggering an influx of U.S. pop culture. McDonald's is now a household word to many Chinese children and China's youth have traded yesterday's navy blue Mao suits for today's jeans. U.S. blockbusters, such as ""True Lies"" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tom Hanks' ""Forrest Gump"", have taken China by storm, raking in millions. Beijing's honeymoon with Washington ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Chinese military crackdown on a student-led drive for democracy in June 1989. Sino-U.S. ties were dealt another jarring blow after the United States allowed a private visit by Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui in June 1995. Beijing regards Taiwan as a rebel province and has sought to push the island into isolation. Sino-U.S. ties have improved since the March war games but China still suspects Washington is trying to contain it. ""The United States does not wish for the rise of a strong country which does not listen to it and does not do things according to its rules,"" said Wang of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

"A Tibetan nun has had her jail term doubled to 18 years for refusing to recognise Beijing's choice as the reincarnation of the region's second holiest monk, the Tibet Information Network (TIN) said on Monday. The sentence of 19-year-old Ngawang Sangdrol, jailed since she was 15, was doubled in July, partly because she refused to accept Beijing's choice as the Panchen Lama, according to the London-based TIN, which monitors human rights in the Himalayan region. ""Ngawang...is now facing (more time) in jail than any other female political prisoner in Tibet,"" TIN said. She is due for release in the year 2010. Officials reached by telephone in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa denied knowledge of the report. The 10th Panchen Lama died in 1989, and Beijing has anointed a six-year-old boy as his reincarnation. The Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, has named another six-year-old boy as the 11th Panchen Lama, and many Tibetans see the Beijing-backed child as a pretender. Beijing's choice is in the Chinese capital under state protection against any possible assassination attempts by radical Tibetans, Chinese sources have said. China denies there are political prisoners in Tibet and says foreign critics of its human rights record are interfering in its internal affairs. Ngawang is already serving nine years -- three years for taking part in a pro-independence demonstration in 1992 and six years for singing nationalist songs in prison in 1993, according to TIN. Her sentence was doubled in part because she refused to tidy her cell in Lhasa's Drapchi prison in March in apparent protest against a political re-education campaign, TIN said. The campaign is designed to force prisoners to accept Beijing's choice as the reincarnated Panchen Lama. Ngawang also refused to stand up in the presence of a Tibetan official, Brigade Commander Khandrol Jangpe, TIN said. The human rights group, which had reported in August that Ngawang was on a restricted diet and confined in a cell with no windows, said it had only recently received confirmation of the longer jail term through a former prisoner who fled Tibet. China has vowed to curb the influence of Buddhism and the Dalai Lama in Tibet, saying socialism must take precedence over religion. The Dalai Lama, the most revered figure in Tibetan Buddhism, fled into exile in India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against communist rule. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaign for autonomy for his homeland. State media have complained that monks and nuns outnumber high school students and that too much money was spent on the region's monasteries. ",BenjaminKangLim
"Chinese activists, in a statement on Tuesday hours ahead of a visit by the U.S. Secretary of State, protested against American backing for Japan's bid to become a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. ""We hold that Japan is not qualified to become a permanent member of the Security Council of the United Nations,"" the activists said in a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is due to arrive in Beijing later on Tuesday for a three-day visit. The letter, signed by 15 activists, said they opposed Japan becoming a permanent member of the Security Council because many Japanese politicians had been reluctant to apologise for its war atrocities and had tried to whitewash history. China says more than 35 million people were killed or wounded during Japan's invasion and occupation of most of China from the early 1930s to 1945. ""(We) strongly protest the U.S. government supporting Japan's (bid) to become a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council to draw Japan over to its side,"" said the letter, a copy of which was made available to Reuters. Tong Zeng, a leader of the group, said he would forward the letter to Christopher through the U.S. embassy in Beijing. The Chinese government, eager for more low-interest loans from Japan, has been reluctant to antagonise Tokyo and has not taken a public stance on the issue. The United States has long supported giving Japan and Germany permanent seats on the Security Council. The council currently consists of five permanent members that were the main victors in World War Two -- the United States, Russia, Britain, China and France -- and 10 non-permanent members who serve two-year terms. Most Chinese have been slow to forgive Japan's war past. ""U.S. backing for Japan's (bid)...will undoubtedly encourage the resurrection of Japanese militarism and bring a new threat to the peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region,"" the letter said. The anti-Japanese activists recounted what they said were U.S. mistakes, including not putting Emperor Hirohito on trial after the end of World War Two in 1945. ""After the end of the war, the United States harmed the feelings of the Chinese people several times...sheltering Japan's top war criminal Emperor Hirohito,"" the letter said. Hirohito died in 1989. The activists also faulted the United States for ""ignoring historical facts"" and handing disputed islands in the East China Sea to Japan in 1971. Sino-Japanese ties were strained this year over the islands, which Beijing calls the Diaoyus and Tokyo the Senkakus. A Japanese right-wing group built a makeshift lighthouse on one of the islands in July, triggering anti-Japanese demonstrations in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Taiwan's Nationalist rulers, who lost the Chinese civil war to the Communists in 1949, also claim the islands. Activists in the British colony of Hong Kong, which reverts to Chinese rule in 1997, have opposed Japan's territorial claims. Emotions were fanned in September when a Hong Kong activist drowned after he jumped into stormy waters around the islands to demonstrate support for Chinese claims. ",BenjaminKangLim
"Bankruptcies in China -- unheard of for almost four decades -- are expected to more than double in number this year as authorities try to shed hopelessly indebted firms. The figure is expected to rise even further next year as officials become more determined not to subsidise loss-making state firms. More than 5,200 Chinese companies were expected to go under in 1996, up from 2,200 in 1995 or more than the previous six years put together, Cao Siyuan, architect of China's bankruptcy law, said. ""Whether enterprises are psychologically prepared for it or not, the rate of bankruptcies gradually increasing is unavoidable,"" Cao said in a recent interview. In the first half of this year, 1,692 enterprises declared bankruptcy, soaring by more than 107 percent compared with the year-ago period, said Cao, who now runs a consultancy to help enterprises seeking to merge or go bankrupt. A total of 1,625 firms declared bankruptcy in 1994, up from 710 in 1993, 428 in 1992, 117 in 1991 and 32 in 1990. China passed a breakthrough bankruptcy law in 1988 in the first flush of an ambitious campaign to force lumbering state-owned enterprises to sink or swim in the marketplace. However, official fears of mass unemployment and social unrest if loss-making firms are allowed to go under has hampered implementation of the bitter medicine. But China was expected to accelerate bankruptcies and mergers of state firms next year to reduce the burden on state coffers and slash subsidies to state enterprises. There is little need for alarm for the ever-increasing number of bankruptcies because it is only a fraction of the total number of enterprises, said Cao. ""One can't say it's too big,"" Cao said of the number of insolvent enterprises. ""Currently, the bankruptcy rate is less than 0.1 percent (of the total number of firms)... One percent is normal."" About one percent of China's estimated 100,000 state enterprises were hopelessly in debt and completely unattractive to investors looking for cheap companies to purchase or to merge with, Cao said. In Huangshi city in the northern province of Hubei, about 80 percent of medium- and large-size state enterprises are losing money, the official People's Daily said. China's state sector reported a historic net loss of 3.0 billion yuan ($361.4 million) in the first quarter, the first such deficit since the country embraced paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms in 1979. The government allocated 20 billion yuan this year to write off bad debts of state firms which go under, but this is hardly enough, the People's Daily said. In Wuhu city in the central province of Anhui, 420 million yuan is needed to write off the bad debts of 35 state firms, but only 50 million yuan has been allocated, the newspaper said. ""Mergers and bankruptcies... are roads without detour,"" the People's Daily, mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, said. ""(Enterprises) which should die should be allowed to die,"" the newspaper said. ""Mergers and bankruptcies are a reform in which we have more to gain than lose."" But bankruptcies and mergers must guard against social unrest, debt evasion and theft of state assets, it said. ($1 = 8.3 yuan) ",BenjaminKangLim
"Two sons of Beijing's disgraced Communist Party boss, Chen Xitong, have been detained and face possible prosecution for economic crimes, Chinese sources said on Friday. The fate of Chen himself was unknown. He was one of the most powerful men in China before his fall in April 1995 after one of his proteges, Beijing Vice-Mayor Wang Baosen, came under investigation for economic crimes and committed suicide. ""It all depends on the (party's) Central Commission for Discipline Inspection...(which) is investigating Chen Xitong,"" one source said in reference to whether the commission would hand Chen's case over to courts for prosecution. Court officials, reached by telephone, declined to comment. ""This is a test of whether the government's anti-corruption drive is for real,"" the source said told Reuters. Critics say the campaign targets only petty officials. Two sources with ties to the party said Chen's eldest son, Chen Xiaoxi, and younger son, Chen Xiaotong, were being held at the Qincheng Prison in a northern suburb of Beijing and faced possible prosecution. The younger son has been in custody since last year but it was unclear when the older son was detained. The sources said they were uncertain over precisely what charges might be filed against either of the two. Prison guards were transferred to Beijing from other provinces to ensure the two men remained under tight security. Beijing was the political powerbase of the family. Outlook magazine, published by the official Xinhua news agency, said this month that Chen Xitong's case ""will not just fade away"". Chen Xitong, 66, has not been seen in public since April 1995 when he resigned as Beijing's Communist Party boss. He was ousted from the party's powerful Politburo in September 1995, becoming the most senior victim of a crackdown on corruption. Chen, who was promoted to the Politburo in recognition of his hardline stand against student-led demonstrations for democracy in Beijing in 1989, is believed to be under virtual house arrest. He is officially said to be under investigation for ""serious mistakes"". Unpublished party documents have said Chen, who ran Beijing for 12 years, first as mayor and then as party boss, had abused his office by amassing $24 million in unauthorised funds and lavishing favours on friends, associates and a mistress. Chen gave nine flats around Beijing to his mistress and her relatives, according to the documents. In December 1995, Beijing Vice-Mayor Zhang Baifa shed light on Chen's whereabouts. Zhang said: ""His life is better than mine... He plays table tennis...eats what he wants."" A second source quoted official documents as saying the younger son illegally channelled government funds to his father's mistress, He Ping. The younger son, a former executive of a Sino-Japanese joint venture hotel in Beijing, also tipped off his father's mistress about the vice-mayor's suicide and told her to go to Hong Kong and not come back, the source said. The brothers are among China's so-called ""princelings"", or children of the ruling party elite who enjoy wide influence due to their top level connections. Corruption was virtually eliminated after the communists came to power in 1949, but has staged a comback along with economic reforms in the past 17 years. ",BenjaminKangLim
"China's breakaway Catholic Church has ordained about 50 graduates of one of the country's biggest seminaries into the priesthood this year, clergy at the seminary said on Monday. The new priests, five of whom were ordained on Sunday, were the first group of clergymen installed by the National Catholic Seminary since 1991, they said. The officially authorised seminary in Beijing did not accept any new students for six years from 1986 due to a lack of funds and space, the clergymen said. ""It's a big problem. Funds are too limited,"" a priest surnamed Meng told Reuters by telephone. The seminary receives 10,000 yuan ($1,200) a year from the government, or one-sixth of its annual budget, another priest said. It raises the rest from donations. Father Meng, who graduated in 1991, said there was no shortage of youths, many of them poor, who wanted to become priests. He and other priests denied that government pressure had played a role in the lack of new students between 1986 and 1991. Catholics in communist China are allowed to worship openly only if they belong to the state-sponsored Catholic Patriotic Association. The association, which supervises the national seminary, appoints its own bishops and does not recognise the Pope as universal Catholic leader. The official church has the blessings of the Communist Party but it too must walk a fine line between the demands of the party elite and the needs of the faithful. The Washington-based Human Rights Watch/Asia has said Beijing has been stepping up harassment of unauthorised Catholic and Protestant groups in recent years. The group said the crackdown on Christians included stricter controls on contacts with foreigners and was part of a broader drive begun in 1994 against all forms of religion as well as political dissent. Bishop Zong Huaide of the state-backed church ordained five graduates of the seminary on Sunday. Zong delivered mass at the Church of the Holy Saviour, built in 1703, which was packed with about 3,000 people. China has 31 seminaries and about 1,100 priests, 700 of whom are state-anointed young men. The official Catholic Church in China counts four million members, while the underground church is believed to have several million members. Vatican relations with Beijing have alternately cooled and warmed over the decades since the late 1950s, when links were severed over the Vatican's recognition of Taiwan. China has said it will not normalise relations until the Vatican severs its ties with Taiwan, which Beijing has regarded as a rebel province since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. The Vatican, on the other hand, has demanded recognition of the Pope's primacy before it renews ties with China. ",BenjaminKangLim
"Chinese President Jiang Zemin tried to reassure Taiwanese businessmen on Thursday, saying Beijing would not allow political differences to stand in the way of trade and investment. ""We maintain that political differences should not be allowed to affect and interfere with economic cooperation between the two sides,"" state radio quoted Jiang as telling visiting Taiwanese business leaders. The economies of China and Taiwan were complementary, Jiang said, adding that the two sides should strengthen economic cooperation to benefit the entire Chinese race. ""We will continue to carry out our long-time policy of encouraging Taiwanese businessmen to invest,"" Jiang was quoted as saying. ""No matter what the circumstances, we will protect all legitimate rights of Taiwanese investors."" A delegation of nearly 80 Taiwanese business leaders and politicians arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for a high-profile visit. Taiwanese economic officials are part of the delegation in a private capacity. Taiwan has banned direct trade, transport and mail links with China since 1949 when the nation's Nationalist rulers fled to the island after their defeat by the communists. Indirect trade and investment has been allowed since the late 1980s, usually through Hong Kong. Jiang said China has always sought to speed up the establishment of direct trade and transport links with Taiwan. Beijing has stepped up pressure on the island to lift the ban. Last week it unilaterally announced a set of regulations to pave the way for direct links. Many Taiwanese businessmen, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, are eager for direct trade and transport, but Taiwan has been reluctant to remove the curbs, which it views as its last bargaining chip in talks with the communists. Kao Ching-yuan, head of the delegation, urged Beijing on Wednesday to resume talks with Taiwan, saying the island's investors would lose confidence in China if political friction impeded ties. The talks were suspended last year after Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui made a landmark trip to the United States. Beijing views the island as a rebel province and insists it is not entitled to official links with other states. Kao, vice-chairman of President Enterprises, a major Taiwanese conglomerate, was quoted by state television as saying the Chinese market had great potential and many Taiwanese businessmen were pushing for expanded economic cooperation. President Enterprises is Taiwan's biggest investor in China. Kao's visit came less than two weeks after Taiwan's President Lee called for a review of economic policy toward China with the aim of avoiding overdependence on the mainland. The Taiwanese delegation was the largest to visit China since a trend of easing tensions was reversed by Lee's mid-1995 U.S. visit. ",BenjaminKangLim
"The seven-year-old boy chosen by China as Tibet's second holiest monk attended a ritual in Beijing last week to celebrate the first anniversary of his enthronement, major Chinese newspapers said on Wednesday. Monks pounded drums, rang bells and chanted Buddhist scriptures as Beijing's choice as the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama visited the Yonghe Lamasery -- the Temple of Harmony and Peace, on November 22, the newspapers said, quoting a report by the official Xinhua news agency. Xinhua gave no reason for the delay in reporting the celebrations which were held a week before the actual anniversary on November 29. Tibet's exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama, has named another boy as the reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama, the Himalayan region's second holiest monk who died in 1989. Many Tibetans see the Chinese-sanctioned child, Gyantsen Norpo, as a pretender. State media has given Beijing's choice much publicity in an apparent bid to convince Tibetans that he is the real reincarnation. Major Chinese newspapers on Wednesday ran a picture of the child wearing traditional robes and a cap and surrounded by monks as he toured the Yonghe Lamasery which was built in 1694. The boy blessed believers and preached from the seat reserved for the 10th Panchen Lama before his death. Chinese sources have said Beijing's choice currently lives in the Chinese capital under state protection against any possible assassination attempts by radical Tibetans. Western human rights groups have accused Beijing of detaining the boy recognised by the Dalai Lama and persecuting monks and nuns who refused to accept Beijing's choice. The London-based human rights watchdog Tibet Information Network said last week a 19-year-old Tibetan nun had her jail term doubled to 18 years for refusing to recognise Beijing's choice. China denies the accusations, saying the Dalai Lama's choice is ""leading a free life, just like other Tibetan children"". But Beijing has refused to reveal the whereabouts of the Dalai Lama's choice or allow diplomats or foreign reporters to meet the boy. China has lashed out at the exiled Tibetan leader, quoting the boy it anointed as the Panchen Lama as saying the Dalai Lama was the cause of turmoil in the region. The Dalai Lama fled his homeland along with thousands of followers in 1959 after an abortive uprising against communist rule. He heads a government-in-exile, which is not recognised by any country, in the Indian town of Dharamsala. The Dalai Lama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaign for autonomy for his homeland, but Beijing views international support for Tibet's holiest man as a Western plot to split China and contain its development.

"China on Thursday savoured its latest victory in a diplomatic tug-of-war with Taiwan, while the stunned island scrambled to limit the damage from South Africa's decision to abandon it. South African President Nelson Mandela said in Johannesburg on Wednesday that Pretoria would switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing by the end of 1997. Beijing hailed the move, saying it was in South Africa's interest. ""We ...welcome President Mandela's positive statement concerning normalisation of relations between China and South Africa,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai told a news briefing in Beijing. ""If South Africa can recognise reality at an earlier date it is in its own interest to do so,"" Cui said. Beijing and Taipei have been diplomatic rivals since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. China regards Taiwan as a rebel province and has sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation. Taiwan insists its 21 million people should have a voice in international affairs. South Africa is the biggest of just 30 states that recognise Taiwan's exiled Republic of China rather than the communist People's Republic on the mainland. The Chinese government spokesman said the People's Republic was the sole, legitimate government of all China. ""South Africa must recognise there is only one China, recognise that Taiwan is a part of China and sever so-called diplomatic relations with Taiwan,"" Cui said. Wealthy but diplomatically isolated Taiwan was stunned by Mandela's announcement and scrambled to limit the damage by urging its 29 other allies not to be swayed by China. ""We hope such a situation won't affect our diplomatic relations with other countries...,"" Taiwan's Foreign Minister John Chang said in a televised news conference in Taipei. ""We will actively negotiate with South Africa in the next 12 months,"" Chang said, adding that he might visit South Africa before an official visit scheduled for January. South Africa's Ambassador to Taiwan Johannes Viljoen urged the island not to exact reprisals against Pretoria. But Taiwan's top economic planner said the island would not continue to encourage investment in South Africa. Tuntex, one of the island's major business groups, said earlier on Thursday it would respect the government's wishes in deciding whether to move ahead with a planned $3 billion petrochemical project in South Africa. Taiwan officials said they would conduct an overall review of Taiwanese investments in South Africa, currently totalling over $1.5 billion. South Africa's decision to switch ties to China sent Taiwan stocks into a brief dive, but the market had recovered by the close. Many businesssmen played down any potential for serious, long-term harm. The Taiwan dollar closed little changed against its U.S. counterpart despite news of the island's diplomatic setback. Taiwanese officials blamed China for South Africa's decision to ditch Taiwan, saying China was ""buying"" foreign ties and damaging chances for reunification between the longtime rivals. There were no protests at Pretoria's embassy in Taipei, contrasting with the public outrage displayed in previous years after Washington, Seoul and other former allies dropped Taipei for Beijing.

"China has retired its navy and air force commanders due to old age, a source familiar with the reshuffle said on Tuesday. Admiral Zhang Lianzhong and Lieutenant General Yu Zhenwu, both 65, have stepped down as navy and air force commanders respectively, said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity. Zhang was replaced by navy deputy commander Rear Admiral Shi Yunsheng, 56, the source said. Yu was succeeded by air force deputy commander Liu Shunyao, believed to be in his early 50s. Communist Party boss Jiang Zemin approved the reshuffle in October in his capacity as chairman of the party's Central Military Commission, or commander-in-chief of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), the source said. Asked if the reshuffle was intended to further consolidate Jiang's power in the military, the source said Zhang and Yu retired due to old age. ""It's professionalisation of the military,"" the source said. However, a Chinese analyst said the four vice-chairmen of the Central Military Commission were already aged between 67 and 82 and still active. The two youngest vice-chairmen were appointed by Jiang. Both the new appointees are believed to be proteges of Jiang, another analyst said. Jiang ordered the promotions of Shi and Yu to navy and air force deputy commanders in January, 1995 and December, 1994 respectively, the analyst said. Some diplomats and Chinese analysts have dismissed Jiang as a transitional figure lacking the personal clout, political power base and administrative ability to step into the shoes of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping after the death of the 92-year-old patriarch. But Jiang, who has no military pedigree, has moved in recent years to shore up his position in the military with a string of reshuffles. The PLA is the world's largest armed force with three million members. It is believed to be planning to pare that number by 500,000 in a streamlining that reflects the end of the Cold War and a desire to redirect state funds to economic development. ",BenjaminKangLim
"A Chinese court has rejected the appeal of veteran dissident Liu Nianchun against a labour camp term for writing petitions, saying freedom of speech must not endanger the security of the state. Beijing's Chaoyang District Court rejected Liu's lawsuit on Monday on the grounds that a petition he initiated in 1995 ""contained attacks against the people's government"", said a copy of the verdict seen by Reuters on Tuesday. The petition ""exceeded the limits of the constitution and the law"", the verdict said. Liu had argued in his appeal that the constitution guaranteed his right to freedom of speech. The court rejected Liu's argument, saying freedom of speech ""must not endanger the security, honour and interests of the state"", the verdict said. Liu's wife, Chu Hailan, said she would appeal even though chances of victory were slim. She has 15 days in which to file an appeal. ""I will definitely appeal. This is our right,"" Chu said by telephone on Tuesday. She attacked the court ruling as ""unfair... not objective and unjust"". Chu said that during the visit of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to China last month police had shunted her to a labour camp in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang where her husband is held to prevent her meeting U.S. officials. ""It's a very desolate place. Life's awfully hard there,"" she said. ""Liu Nianchun... eats only two meals a day."" She said her husband was sharing a 14-square-metre (150 square-ft) cell with 15 other people. Last July, police ordered Liu, 48, to serve three years of re-education through labour on top of nearly one year in detention for drafting the petition, which urged the government to re-evaluate its crackown on student demonstrators in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, and to free all political prisoners. He was also accused of accepting illegal aid from human rights organisations abroad and of trying to form a group to promote protection of workers' rights. Re-education through labour is a form of administrative punishment that can be imposed by the authorities without recourse to prosecutors or the courts. Western human rights activists say it is increasingly favoured by the authorities as a way of removing dissidents from circulation without the complications and publicity of a trial. Liu took part in the Democracy Wall movement of the early 1980s and was sentenced in 1981 to a three-year jail term for ""counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement"", or subversion. Prominent dissident and former student leader Wang Dan, who drafted the petition together with Liu, was sentenced to 11 years in prison last month for conspiring to subvert the government -- a sentence that triggered international condemnation. China dismisses criticism of its human rights record as interference in its internal affairs. The Chinese authorities have dealt crushing blows to the struggling democracy movement in recent months. Most dissidents have already been forced into exile or are serving long sentences in prison or in labour camps. Three pro-democracy activists are currently standing trial on charges of counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement in Hefei, capital of the central province of Anhui. In the southern boomtown of Shenzhen that adjoins Hong Kong, two labour activists are standing trial for conspiring to subvert the government. ",BenjaminKangLim
"China pledged on Wednesday to curb a rush by provinces to invest in high-profile industries, but economists said defiance from regional authorities would impede attempts by the central government to restructure the economy. The People's Daily, mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, said many new state enterprises were doomed from the beginning due to blind investment in many provinces. ""From the day production began, (many enterprises) entered a vicious cycle of high investment, high consumption of resources, low production efficiency and poor management,"" the newspaper said in a front-page commentary. Many old enterprises, unable to upgrade their technology, lose their competitive edge and become inefficient, it said. The newspaper said blind investment was widespread, citing 22 provinces that listed car production as one of their pillar industries in their Five-Year Plan between 1996 and 2000 and the plan for 2010. Twenty-four provinces listed electronics as one of their pillar industries through 2000, and 16 provinces said they would concentrate on machinery and chemicals, the newspaper said. ""This has been a major problem for China's economy for a long time,"" economist Mao Tianqi said in a telephone interview when asked about the blind investment. Blind investment had also led to monopolies and local protectionism, with many provinces banning competitive products from neighbouring regions, the newspaper said. It said China's economic structure was ""unreasonable"", with too many small enterprises, not enough large enterprises, too many low-end products and insufficient high technology items. The central government planned to restructure the economy next year to curb concentration in high-profile industries and to boost efficiency, the newspaper said. ""Restructuring the economy...is a mission of extreme importance,"" it said. The central government would try to divert investment into the manufacturing of products with big demand as well as high technology products, the newspaper said. It did not elaborate. The government would try to break monopolies by encouraging joint ventures among provinces, the newspaper said, adding that business groups would be encouraged to shed affiliates that are not related to production, such as hospitals and kindergartens. ""There are many difficulties and contradictions in adjusting and improving the economic structure, but...the State Council's (cabinet's) determination will not waver,"" the newspaper said. But economist Mao was not optimistic. ""This is not a problem that can be resolved in one year,"" Mao said. Many local governments would defy or skirt decisions by the central government to limit investment in certain industries to a few regions, he said. About one percent of China's estimated 100,000 state enterprises are hopelessly in debt and unattractive to investors looking for cheap companies to buy or to merge with. The government has been dragging its feet on bankruptcies due to fears of mass unemployment and social unrest. However, the number of bankruptcies in China -- unheard of for almost four decades -- was expected to more than double to 5,200 this year, or more than the total of the previous six years put together.

"China's parliament, eager to shed its rubber stamp image, has vowed to crack down on lawless officials by intensifying supervision of the government's executive and judicial branches. Tian Jiyun, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress, had conceded that the problem of officials disregarding the law was very serious in some departments, major newspapers said on Friday. ""Some officials are not strict when implementing the law and do not investigate legal violations,"" Tian told the opening of a nine-day seminar in the booming southern city of Shenzhen on Thursday. ""These phenomena are very serious in some regions and departments,"" said Tian, a member of the ruling Communist Party's 19-member Politburo. Official media frequently carry reports of abuse of power by local officials, who run their areas of jurisdiction as virtual fiefdoms. The word of an official is often taken as law. ""Some officials go as far as to replace the law with their word,"" Tian said. ""There are laws but some officials do not do things according to the law. ""Some use power to suppress the law, those enforcing the law break the law and some take the law into their own hands."" Some Chinese analysts saw Tian's remarks as an attempt to increase the say of parliament in Chinese politics. Tian and his mentor, Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People's Congress, who sits on the party's omnipotent seven-member Standing Committee, have moved in recent years to boost the status of parliament. Tian urged lawmaking bodies at all levels to step up supervision of the executive and judicial branches. ""Supervision is a very weak link of the work of the People's Congress,"" Tian said. He urged all lawmakers to conscientiously supervise trials and the work of the government, prosecutors and police. Last month, a court took 10 minutes to reject the appeal of dissident and former student leader Wang Dan and uphold an 11-year jail term for conspiring to subvert the government. Another dissident, Chen Longde, attempted suicide in August by jumping from a third-floor window because he could no longer stand beating by guards at a labour camp, his family has said. The labour camp denies any wrongdoing. Chen, who broke his right leg and smashed three teeth, has been discharged from hospital and sent back to the labour camp, where he is serving three years of re-education through labour for sending a petition to parliament demanding the release of all political prisoners. Re-education through labour is a form of administrative punishment that can be imposed by authorities without recourse to prosecutors or the courts. Western human rights activists say the punishment is increasingly favoured by the authorities as a way of removing dissidents from circulation without the complications and publicity of a trial.

"A Chinese court has jailed a 56-year-old dissident for five years for subversion, dealing another blow to the country's tiny, struggling democracy movement. The Intermediate People's Court in Xi'an city, in the northern province of Shaanxi, convicted Zhang Zong'ai this week of spreading ""counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement"", his lawyer, Zhang Jiankang, said on Saturday. The dissident, detained since June, has appealed to the Shaanxi provincial Higher People's Court, the Hong Kong-based Human Rights and Democracy in China Information Centre said. ""Their (Chinese authorities) intention is to kill the chicken for the monkey to see... to frighten other dissidents,"" a spokesman for the centre, which monitors human rights abuses in China, said in a telephone interview. Zhang was previously jailed for five years for demanding Premier Li Peng be impeached for ordering the military to crush student-led pro-democracy demonstrations centred in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in June 1989, the human rights watchdog said. He lost his seat in the local lawmaking body along with his teaching job at the Xi'an Institute of Statistics and his wife divorced him after his incarceration in 1989, his family said. Asked to comment on Zhang's latest conviction, his sister, Zhang Xin, said he was innocent. ""He was wrongly accused,"" the sister said by telephone. ""He didn't commit any crime... He didn't do anything."" His lawyer told Reuters the court had found Zhang guilty of attacking China's judiciary in an interview with former student leader Wang Dan that was later published in a Hong Kong newspaper. Wang, a former student leader of the 1989 democracy demonstrations, was sentenced to 11 years in prison last month for conspiring to subvert the government. The court also found Zhang guilty of signing a petition last year urging authorities to show political tolerance, the lawyer said. The court cleared Zhang of any wrongdoing in accepting money from an overseas group, the lawyer said. The court ruled Zhang did accept money but that he did not use the funds for counter-revolutionary activities. The lawyer said the verdict also did not mention a charge in the bill of indictment that accused Zhang of ""pledging loyalty"" to the Taiwan authorities by writing to General Wego Chiang. Chiang is the sole surviving son of the late Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, who fled to Taiwan after losing the Chinese civil war to the Communists in 1949. China regards Taiwan as a rebel province. The dissident had not mailed a letter to Chiang that was found in his home in Xi'an. Beijing's Communists and Taipei's Nationalists have been political rivals for almost five decades. In recent months, the Chinese authorities have dealt crushing blows to the struggling democracy movement. Most dissidents have already been forced into exile or are serving long sentences in prison or labour camps. China dismisses criticism of its human rights record as interference in its internal affairs. Three pro-democracy activists are currently standing trial on charges of counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement in Hefei, capital of the central province of Anhui. In the southern boomtown of Shenzhen that neighbours Hong Kong, two labour activists are standing trial for conspiring to subvert the government. ",BenjaminKangLim
"Taiwanese business leader Kao Ching-yuan has invited one of China's top policymakers on Taiwan to visit the island, but Beijing was tight-lipped on whether to accept the offer. The invitation was offered to Wang Zhaoguo, director of the Chinese cabinet's Taiwan Affairs Office, in a private capacity, a spokesman for Kao told Reuters. If Wang accepted and Taiwanese authorities allowed him to visit, he would be the most senior Chinese official to set foot on the island since the end of China's civil war in 1949. Wang was quoted by the spokesman as saying he would be happy to visit if he had an opportunity, but there was no definite commitment to accept. ""If there was this opportunity, he would be very happy to go (to Taiwan). There is no definite concrete time,"" the spokesman said, speaking by telephone from the north China city of Tangshan. In Taipei, a spokesman for the cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, which formulates Taiwan's policy towards China, said the council would be happy to see a visit by Wang but noted that procedures must be followed. The Taiwan Affairs Office declined to comment on the council spokesman's remarks. Earlier, the office denied Taiwanese newspaper reports that Wang had accepted the invitation. Kao is head of a delegation of nearly 80 Taiwanese businessmen, economists and officials, who arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for a 12-day visit. Chinese President Jiang Zemin met members of the delegation on Thursday and tried to reassure Taiwanese investors, saying Beijing would not allow political differences to stand in the way of trade and investment. In his meetings with other Chinese officials, Kao, vice-chairman of President Enterprises, had raised tax and labour problems faced by Taiwanese investors in China, the delegation's spokesman said. President Enterprises is Taiwan's biggest investor in China. On Wednesday, Kao urged Beijing to resume talks with Taiwan, saying the island's investors would lose confidence in China if political friction impeded ties. The talks were suspended last year after Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui's landmark trip to the United States. Beijing has viewed Taiwan as a rebel province since the Nationalist government collapsed on the mainland and fled to the island in 1949. China insists Taiwan is not entitled to official links with other states. China has stepped up pressure on Taiwan to lift a decades-old ban on direct trade and transport links between the two sides. Last week Beijing unilaterally announced a set of regulations to pave the way for direct links. Taiwan has banned direct trade, transport and mail links since 1949. Indirect trade and investment has been allowed since the late 1980s, usually through Hong Kong. Many Taiwanese business executives, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, are eager for direct trade and transport, but Taiwan has been reluctant to remove the curbs, which it views as its last bargaining chip in talks with the communists.

"The Commmonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) warned again on Tuesday of a subdued profit outlook for the current 1996/97 year and beyond, citing a competitive housing market, falling margins and higher wage costs. CBA chairman Tim Besley told shareholders at the bank's annual meeting that nothing in the first three months of the year had changed earlier forecasts of flat profits in the current year to June 30, 1997.   ""We are now three months into the financial year and nothing has changed to prompt the bank to revise this assessment,"" Besley said in his chairman's address. ""1996/97 is shaping up to be every bit as challenging as we envisaged,"" he said. ""The home loan market remains intensely competitive."" Commonwealth Bank reported a net profit of A$1.12 billion in 1995/96, up from A$983 million in 1994/95, and said when it released its results in August that it expected earnings to be flat in 1996/97.   Besley said CBA's directors aimed to maintain the ratio of dividends per share to earnings per share at around 80 percent in 1996/97. However, Besley also said later at the meeting that banking industry profits could fall over the long run and that CBA would have to work hard to ensure its profit falls were less than those of other banks. ""We have to be sure that ours (profits) come down by as little as any of the others,"" Besley said in answer to a shareholder's question.   Besley later told reporters banking industry profits would be under pressure in the future. ""The industry will be under pressure of falling profits unless, just like in any other industry, it pays great attention to its costs and gets very efficient,"" he said. ""There's no suggestion that (the CBA's) profits would fall off this year,"" he said, adding that it was the bank's objective to increase profits in 1997/98. CBA Managing Director David Murray also played down Besley's earlier comments. ""I read that comment to mean a fall in the growth rate in profits,"" he said.   When asked if he too aimed for a rebound from the flat 1996/97 to profit growth in 1997/98, Murray said: ""Yes. It means marketing better and containing our costs."" But he said it was too early to be specific about a possible profit rise in 1997/98. Murray however also told the annual meeting that cost control would be difficult. He said CBA had restricted wages growth to four percent in the two years before the most recently negotiated enterprise bargaining agreements.   ""That (four percent over two years) is clearly not sustainable with the inflation rate and wage expectations where they are but we continue to bargain hard on that front."" CBA's share price closed down 11 cents at A$11.90, having earlier fallen to A$11.80 on the bearish comments from the annual meeting. ""It's all on this talk of no earnings growth and wages pressure,"" one Melbourne broker said before the late session bounce. Murray and Besley also repeated their view that official interest rates were more likely to be cut than raised before the end of the year.   -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800 ",BernardHickey
"Rupert Murdoch predicted he would win his legal battle with Ted Turner and Time Warner Inc. and said his global media company, News Corp. Ltd., was on track to boost profits 20 percent this year. In remarks published in News Corp.'s Courier Mail newspaper in Brisbane, Murdoch also was quoted as saying that he did not want to buy out Australia's other major newspaper publisher, John Fairfax Holdings Ltd. News Corp. publishes major tabloid newspapers in Sydney and Melbourne, the Courier Mail and The Australian, also owns about 5 percent of Fairfax. Discussing his recent feud with CNN founder Ted Turner and Time Warner, Murdoch said he was confident News Corp. would win its lawsuit against the $6.7 billion merger of Turner Broadcasting System Inc. and New York-based Time Warner, which was completed on Thursday after shareholders of both companies approved the deal. ""We've got a good stoush (fight) there,"" Murdoch said. ""We'll win through there. How or where I don't know but we'll just keep the pressure on,"" he said. Turner said on Thursday that Murdoch's lawsuit to block the merger of Turner Broadcasting and Time Warner, which creates the world's biggest media company, was a ""frivolous piece of junk."" Murdoch and Turner have fought a pitched battle in recent months over the merger. At issue is whether Time Warner, the United States' second-largest cable operator, will carry Murdoch's new all-news channel that will compete with CNN. News Corp. is seeking $1 billion in damages from Time Warner and Turner, saying their decision not to carry News Corp.'s 24-hour Fox News Service showed they were stifling competition. ""They promised me very firmly we'd have 9 million subscribers and when the day came to sign the document, they weren't there,"" Murdoch said in the interview, referring to Time Warner's decision not to carry the new channel. Turner was forced to apologise last week for comparing Murdoch to Adolf Hitler, while Murdoch has described CNN as liberal and his executives have said Turner was monopolistic. Murdoch also confirmed his bullish outlook for News Corp.'s profits. ""If the American economy holds where it is and the British one does, yes certainly,"" a 20 percent rise in profits is attainable, he told the Courier Mail. ""But it is still early days to be saying that."" News Corp. said after releasing its results in late August that a 20 percent profit rise in the year to June 30, 1997 was attainable. News earned A$1.02 billion ($790 million) net profit in fiscal 1996. Murdoch also said he had no plans to buy out John Fairfax Holdings, which publishes broadsheet newspapers in Sydney and Melbourne and is News Corp.'s major competitor in newspaper market. He said Australian-based rival media owner Kerry Packer was also unlikely to bid for Fairfax any time soon. ""I don't want to buy Fairfax. I don't believe Mr. (Kerry) Packer wants to buy Fairfax,"" he was quoted as saying. ""To my knowledge he (Packer) has three times tried to sell his shares within the last 12 months. He'd like to influence and have the power of Fairfax but he's too shrewd to be paying for Fairfax at today's price."" Canada's Conrad Black, whose Hollinger International Inc. owns 25 percent of Fairfax and who has expressed a desire to take control of the group, expressed surprise at Murdoch's comments. ""(Murdoch's statement) is fairly humorous. It's a bit rich given the fact that he never stops telling me how much he would like to own Fairfax,"" Black said by telephone Friday. ""I cannot obviously comment on what the others are doing or what Rupert's motives are. The fact is that he regularly expresses to me considerable hypothetical interest in Fairfax,"" he said. Hollinger International owns the Chicago Sun-Times, daily and weekly publications in the United States and the Jerusalem Post. ",BernardHickey

Murdoch then said the government's investigation of the current cross-media rules, which stop the dual ownership of newspapers and television stations in the same city, would benefit Packer. Murdoch predicted the cross-media restrictions would be removed, but that foreign ownership rules would stay. ""So it will leave things open for him (Packer) and not for us,"" Murdoch said. The rules currently stop Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd from increasing its 15 percent holding in Fairfax while it owns the top-rating Nine Network.   They also stop Murdoch's News from increasing its 15 percent stake in the Seven Network Ltd while it owns News Ltd newspaper publishing change. Foreign ownership rules stop News from increasing its five percent stake in Fairfax. Asked what he expected to emerge from the government's investigation into the cross-media rules, Murdoch said: ""I think whatever Mr Packer wants.

"Media magnate Rupert Murdoch said on Tuesday that the first quarter performance of his global media group, The News Corp Ltd, had been below expectations, but that he was still confident of a 20 percent profit rise in 1996/97.

""We still expect that and are still aiming for that during the coming year. However, I should say that the first quarter may not be quite up to those expectatations, but we will certainly be striving to make up any shortfall,"" he said. In the 1995/96 year ended June 30, News Corp's net profit slipped to A$1.02 billion (US$806 million) from A$1.37 billion in 1994/95.

"Rupert Murdoch on Tuesday reported that News Corp Ltd had performed below expectations in the first quarter, but he said the global media group was still on track for a 20-percent profit rise this year.

Analysts viewed the comments as disappointing and said they were now more sceptical about the 20-percent profit pledge. ""If they can't meet expectations in the first quarter, when they have those strong revenues from Independence Day, then what hope do they have of getting 20 percent in the full year?"" asked one Sydney-based media analyst referring to a hit Hollywood movie made by News Corp's Fox studio.

"Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) took the unusual step on Monday of categorically denying a newspaper report which said it was investigating a A$24 billion merger with Britain's Standard Chartered Plc. ""ANZ advises that it is not investigating or discussing a merger with Standard Chartered Bank,"" ANZ said in a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange just before the start of trade. ""Whilst we do not normally comment on rumours and speculation regarding mergers and acquisitions the very specific nature of the article requires this definite denial,"" the ANZ said in a statement. Earlier, an ANZ spokesman had told Reuters that the report was in the category of market speculation and would not be commented on. In its Monday edition, the Australian Financial Review reported that the two banks had engaged Goldman Sachs and Swiss Bank Corp to conduct a feasibility study into a merger ""along the lines of the RTZ-CRA stock stapling"".   RTZ Corp Plc and CRA Ltd merged to become a dual-listed company and the world's biggest mining group in December last year. ""Such an alliance would make ANZ almost takeover-proof in Australia, preserving the relative independence of one of the two major banks considered most likely takeover targets after the Wallis inquiry into the financial system,"" the Financial Review said.   ""There are no cross-shareholdings between ANZ and Standard Chartered and the issue of 'senior partner' in a stock stapling would be expected to be significant as would government and regulatory approval of the deal,"" the paper said, adding that KPMG had been employed to carry out due diligence on the deal. The bank's surprisingly specific denial came after analysts said ANZ's share price could drop sharply on the report. The analysts said the merger as outlined in the report was unlikely to include much if any takeover premium for shareholders, meaning the premium of up to 10 percent built into the current share price would be stripped out.   ""People are saying 'What's in it for shareholders?',"" BNP Equities banking analyst Linda Lyon said. ""If a merger like that looks like coming off, then the price will come off,"" Lyon said. ""The sort of deal we're talking about doesn't include any sort of takeover premium for shareholders,"" said a senior Sydney banking analyst. ""People have been buying ANZ above its true value in expectation NAB (National Australia Bank Ltd ) will launch a takeover post-Wallis,"" the analyst said.   ""My guess is that the immediate reaction would be negative,"" he said, adding he saw ANZ's true price at around A$6.50. But after the denial, ANZ's share price rose with the rest of the market. It was up two cents at A$7.18 at 12.50 p.m. (0150 GMT).

"Gold miner Niugini Mining Ltd, which owns 17.15 percent of the shares in Papua New Guinea's Lihir Gold Ltd, said on Monday it was looking at ways of giving those Lihir shares back to its shareholders. ""We're looking at the possibility of returning the Lihir shareholding to shareholders and when that can be done,"" Nuigini Mining chief executive Ian Goudie told Reuters. Goudie said a straight forward return of the shares to shareholders could not approved until late 1998 given the Lihir mine's current debt arrangements.   But Nuigini was also looking at other structures through which the shares could be returned before then, he said. He said the Lihir share return was just one of several possible ways of unlocking the true value of the Lihir stake, which was not reflected in Niugini's current share price. ""The whole purpose is to unlock this mismatch,"" he said. Niugini's assets could viewed in two parts -- the Lihir stake and other smaller mining assets, he said.

"Australian-based insurer QBE Insurance Group Ltd said on Tuesday that profit growth was likely to surge into the high teens for the full 1996/97 year after only a slight increase in its first quarter profit. ""I'm confident that it will be in the teens, and with a bit of luck it will probably be in the high teens,"" QBE managing director John Cloney told reporters after the group's annual meeting when asked about profit growth for the full year. Earlier QBE reported a first quarter net profit of A$28.5 million, up just slightly from A$28.0 million a year earlier.   QBE's full year net profit rose 15.1 percent to A$123.3 million in 1995/96 ended June 30. Analysts said the first quarter result may have been disappointing, partly due to costs linked to the installation of a new computer system, but the bullish comments were a welcome tonic. ""We're still very happy to see around 15 percent profit growth per annum,"" said First Pacific insurance analyst Greg Galton. QBE's share price responded in kind, rising 15 cents to A$6.70 in early Tuesday afternoon trade after Cloney's comments.   Cloney also said that QBE expected reduced expense ratios over 1996/97 because of improved productivity linked to the new computer systems. QBE should also achieve its target of double digit premium growth from existing lines and lower acquisition costs, he said. He also said he saw a continuation of the trend of previous years of increased dividends, but that the franking rate was likely to be reduced to about 50 percent as previously foreshadowed.   Cloney said QBE's A$70 million acquisition of the British reinsurance assets of Allstate Insurance Co announced in September would also boost profits in 1996/97. ""That will give us in excess of 15 percent return (on equity invested) in this fiscal year,"" he said. Referring to this strong rate of return from this latest acquisition, Cloney said QBE continued to be on the look-out for similarly profitable acquisitions. ""We are on the lookout all the time, and there are a couple of things that may come to pass,"" Cloney said, adding however that he could not be more specific.   But he said Australia was less likely to be a happy hunting ground for QBE because other competitors and banks were prepared to bid high prices and push down rates of return. ""They're the sort of hurdle rates we set,"" he said, referring to the 15 percent-plus return likely from Allstate. ""Because we're already earning 17 percent (return on shareholders funds) we're not in the position to spend up large and say we'll get a pay back in three or four years, because it will dilute our overall earnings,"" he said.   ""So far as Australia is concerned, to acquire at the sort of hurdle rates of return we're looking for is a little difficult because I think there are more people interested in what's available here than overseas."" Cloney also ruled out any bank acquisitions. ""QBE ought to be allowed to buy a bank if it wishes to do so but it is my own personal view and, I believe the view of the board, that we will not be doing that,"" he said. -- Bernard Hickey -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1812 ",BernardHickey
"Stock-feed producer Ridley Corp Ltd forecast on Wednesday that slow demand and margin pressures would produce a flat first half year profit, but that a grain price slump would help boost profits for the full 1996/97 year. ""All things considered we expect overall company after tax earnings to be in line with those of last year for the first half,"" Ridley Chairman John Keniry told the group's annual meeting.   Strong pasture growth in some areas which had significantly cut demand for stockfeed, along with margin pressures from high wheat prices earlier the year had combined to push Australian stockfood earnings lower in the first quarter of the year to June 30, 1997. First quarter earnings from Ridley's AgriProducts division had been below both budget forecast and last year's results, Keniry said. Keniry said Ridley expected another good result from its Canadian stock food supplier, Feed-rite, to offset the falls from Australia's AgriProducts in the first half.   ""For the first quarter Feed-Rite's earnings before interest and tax have exceeded by a comfortable margin both budget and last year,"" Keniry said. But he said a sharp slump in grain prices, one of Ridley's key inputs, could boost margins again in Australia later in the year if prices stayed down. ""When we look to the full year, we must recognise a very rapid decline in the past month or so in grain prices, and the somewhat unpredicatble impact on both us and our customers of these changes,"" Keniry said.   ""Nevertheless on a full year basis, a cautious approach would be to say that we presently expect to come in slightly ahead of last year,"" he said. Ridley said last month it expected continued profit growth and was optimistic of achieving another record performance in the 1996/97 year to June 30. It reported an operating profit of A$36.27 million million in 1995/96, up 14.3 percent on the previous year and hard on the heels of three to four years of significant profit rises.   Later, Ridley managing director Gary Busenshut reiterated the flat immediate outlook but more buoyant longer term prospects for the year. ""As we harvest between October and January, we're going to see some improvement in margins,"" he said. Busenshut said Ridley also continued to focus on further acquisitions both in Australia and in North America, particularly now that its A$98 million takeover bid for Australian malster Joe White Maltings Ltd looked unlikely to succeed.   The A$5.44 per share offer was rejected by Joe White and Ridley has said it would not increase the offer before it closes on November 8. Ridley now has about 18 percent of Joe White. Ridley would continue to look at potential malting acquisitions in Australia and stock-feed milling operations in North America, Busenshuts said. He said Ridley had had discussions with potential feed-milling targets in North America and could carry out an acquisition worth about A$100 million by the end of the March quarter of 1997 if it decided to. Ridley's shares closed up one cent at A$1.70.  -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1812 ",BernardHickey
"Water filtration company Memtec Ltd is confident the failure of its planned US$280 million takeover bid for U.S. medical filtration company Gelman Sciences Inc will not affect earnings or its U.S. expansion plans. Memtec chairman Denis Hanley told Reuters in a telephone interview from the United States that a compensation clause in the original takeover deal negotiated with Gelman meant it would not affect Memtec's earnings in the year to June 30, 1997.   ""There were clauses in the contract that compensated us for our effort,"" Hanley said. ""It will have no impact on our normal earnings,"" he said. In July, Gelman said it had agreed to be taken over by the NASDAQ-listed Memtec, which offered 1.05 Memtec American Depositary Receipts (ADRS) for each Gelman share. The offer than valued each Gelman share at about US$35 a share, but Memtec's share price fell after the July announcement and the agreement included a clause allowing Gelman to renegotiate or terminate the deal if Memtec's share price fell below US$30.   On Monday, Gelman agreed to a takeover bid by fellow filtration company Pall Corp, which valued Gelman's shares at US$33 per share and effectively trumped Memtec's bid. Memtec then said on Tuesday it would not increase its bid and that the original merger agreement had been terminated. Hanley said he and Memtec's management had spent months preparing for the Gelman takeover and organising a roadshow promoting the bid, but that Memtec had been compensated for the costs involved. He said Memtec's likely growth in the United States this year would not be affected by failure of the deal.   ""This year the growth we'll probably see will still be better than 50 percent without this deal,"" he said. Memtec remained on the lookout for expansion opportunities in the United States, particularly in the medical filtration sector. ""We see many ways of getting into the medical market there,"" he said, adding however that he could not be specific about how Memtec would increase its presence. Gelman makes microfiltration products for laboratories, healthcare, environmental monitoring, high-technology process industries and other uses.   The end of the Gelman deal has pleased shareholders however, with Memtec's shares jumping A$3.50 to A$41.50 by Wednesday's close from its A$35 level on Monday.

"Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd is likely to benefit from the planned US$20 billion merger of MCI Communications Corp and British Telecommunications Plc, Australian media analysts said on Monday. News Corp, which already has a wide-ranging partnership with MCI, would strengthen its global media interests on the coat-tails of the creation of the world's second largest telecommunications group, the analysts said. ""It means they'll be in bed with a bigger, more powerful global telephony group,"" one senior Sydney media analyst said. Analysts also said the BT-MCI merger would stabilise New Corp's partnership with MCI, which had seemed increasingly strained in recent months. ""It seems that MCI and News haven't been getting on lately, whereas News and BT have been getting on a lot better,"" said the Sydney analyst. The prospect of MCI selling its nine percent stake in News Corp over the next year had suppressed News Corp's shares last month. ""There was a view that MCI wasn't real happy with it (the partnership) and may sell out, but now nothing's going to happen for 12 months at least,"" said another Sydney analyst. ""The implications for News are quite positive."" A Melbourne analyst said some in the market were a bit worried that MCI was preparing to sell down its stake over the next 12 months. ""The fact that BT may combine with MCI reduces that risk for now at least,"" one analyst said. MCI and News Corp announced a broad alliance in May 1995, under which MCI bought a nine percent stake in News for US$1.35 billion and acquired an option to increase that stake to 13.5 percent. They agreed, among other things, to jointly set up an American satellite television operation -- ASkyB. But progress with ASkyB has been slow and other smaller joint ventures have failed to fire. Australian analysts said they would remain cautious towards ASkyB, given bearish comments on Sunday by MCI. MCI announced that it would cut its stake in ASkyB to 20 percent from 50 percent. Analysts said this was not surprising as News Corp and MCI had said recently they wanted new partners in the venture. MCI Chief Executive Bert Roberts told Reuters on Sunday that no major new launches were expected from the venture with News Corp and that MCI wanted to sell a US$700 million satellite license to News. He also said MCI was unlikely to take up its option to increase its stake in News, a comment seen by analysts as symptomatic of Roberts' increasing unhappiness with the deal. Analysts also warned there was a potential regulatory block to links between News, its 40 percent owned BSkyB Plc, and BT. ""There's an outside risk that British regulatory bodies could try and block the News-BSkyB-BT side of it,"" said a BT analyst. Other analysts said the dilution involved, with BT owning nine percent of a 40 percent stake in BSkyB, would assuage regulatory concerns. The likely election of a British Labour government also reduced that risk. ""They're banking on (Labour leader) Tony Blair winning government and deregulating cross media rules in the United Kingdom,"" said another Sydney analyst. However, another analyst pointed to the recent banning by British regulator Oftel of a joint marketing campaign between BT and BSkyB as a sign of the rocky road ahead for News and BT. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1812 ",BernardHickey
"Appliance and building products manufacturer Email Ltd reported a lower half year net profit and dividend on Monday but forecast that recent restructuring and a seasonal lift would boost profits in the second half. Email said the environment for industrial activities remained difficult and recent economic forecasts had deferred the timing of an upturn in building sector.   ""Nevertheless, the significant improvements in the company's pre-tax operating profits flowing from restructuring across the past 12 months, are expected to continue in the second half,"" the company said in a statement accompanying half year results. ""As well there should be the normal seasonal lift in sales and margins, leading to a second half profit well ahead of the first half,"" it said. Earlier Email reported a pre-abnormal net profit of A$27.26 million for the first half to September 30, up from A$24.83 million the previous corresponding half a year earlier.   Net profit however fell to A$23.85 million from A$26.61 million the previous year, due largely to abnormal losses of A$3.41 million incurred in restructuring and reducing overheads. Email also cut its interim dividend to eight cents from 11.5 a year earlier, saying it had realigned dividends to reflect the stronger second half year in the light of continuing uncertainty about the economy. Email Managing Director John Hanna later told Reuters Email expected pre-tax profits for the second half of the 1996/97 year would also be above those in the second half of 1995/96.   ""We are expecting in the second half that we would have pre-tax operating profits higher than last year,"" Hanna said. ""We should also have the second half seasonal lift."" He said Email was pleased that it achieved profit growth in its building products and major appliances divisions despite lower sales. Analysts said the result was within expectations and was largely unsurprising, even with the dividend cut. ""It's still a high payout ratio,"" said one Sydney analyst said of the dividend, noting that the final dividend was likely to be maintained.   Email's share price was unchanged at A$3.55 at 1.10 p.m. (0210 GMT) on light volumes. Hanna said there could begin to be an upturn in the housing industry at the beginning of 1997, but that this would take some time to flow through to Email's business because its products were installed late in the building process. ""If it (the upturn) was early 1997, then it (the resulting flow-on) would be in mid-1997,"" he said. But this flow-on effect would then have an immediate effect on Email's bottom line because of the recent restructuring which had reduced overheads.   ""As there's an upturn, we should get that immediately and a lot of that will go to the bottom line immediately,"" Hanna said. He also said Email may increase its 20 percent stake in British electricity meter maker Ampy Automation Digilog Ltd. ""There may be an opportunity to lift that stake in the future,"" Hanna said. He said Email remained on the lookout for further acquisitions. ""They (any further acquisitions) would have to be in existing core areas ... but I don't think we have anything directly in line at the moment,"" he said. -- Bernard Hickey 61-2 9373-1812 ",BernardHickey

"National Mutual Holdings Ltd managing director Geoff Tomlinson said on Thursday that strong investment markets meant group earnings for the 1996/97 year were likely to be in line with the July prospectus forecasts. ""It's been a very kind year. I can't think of when the markets have been more conducive to our type of business,"" Tomlinson told Reuters in an interview.   He said he could not give a formal forecast of the profit result for the just completed year to September 30 but an examination of the assumptions in National Mutual's share offer document would show the forecasts were likely to be met. ""You can go back and look at the investment assumptions in the share offer document and compare them with where we were at the end of September and we were in the fortunate position where most of the markets finished in line with predictions,"" he said. ""That would give you some underlying view that it's likely that our performance will be in line with that projection.""   National Mutual forecast in its offer document a consolidated net profit after tax of A$198 million for the year ending September 30, up from A$115.5 million in 1994/95.

"Australian-based metals recycler Simsmetal Ltd on Friday painted a bleak picture for world scrap metal prices over the year ahead and said this meant the group's net profit for 1996/97 would be lower than in 1995/96. But it said it remained confident it could take advantage of a recovery in world markets when it came and was currently in talks to buy a large British scrap metal business. Simsmetal managing director John Crabb told the annual meeting that scrap prices had softened dramatically to their lowest levels in almost four years over the last two months.   ""Until there is an improvement in the major economies of Europe and Asia and the resulting increase in demand for metals, we expect trading conditions to remain very difficult with volumes, margins and earnings below our expectations,"" Crabb said. He later told reporters profits for the year to June 30, 1997 would be below the A$46.7 million posted in 1995/96 -- a result that was itself 23 percent down on a year ago. ""It will be lower for the full year,"" Crabb said.   Simsmetal had previously only said it saw difficult conditions prevalent in the first quarter of 1996/97 continuing into the second quarter, with second quarter profits falling. In mid-October, Simsmetal announced its net profit for the first quarter of 1996/97 fell 34 percent to A$8.28 million. Crabb said the world construction markets which used the long steel produced by electric furnaces supplied by Simsmetal remained weak and had no immediate prospect of improvement. ""Our view is that we should start to see some improvement (in ferrous metals prices) towards the end of calendar 1997, we may see it in the middle (of calendar 1997),"" he said.   ""We can't see too much on the horizon at this time,"" he said. Crabb also said Simsmetal was in talks to buy a large British business in the same area as Simsmetal, but he said he could not give any more details as he was bound by confidentiality agreements. ""It's in the U.K. For us it will be quite large,"" he said. ""We still need to balance our portfolio there, so that we've got a good broad coverage,"" he said. ""We'll use either some cash or our unusued borrowing lines. We've got no problems funding it.""   He said Simsmetal had ended the first quarter with about A$62 million cash on hand. ""I guess we'd only be using 55-60 percent of our borrowing capacity at the moment."" Simsmetal had total non-current borrowings of A$54.11 million as at June 30, 1996, giving a total warchest for possible acquisitions of about A$115 million. Earlier in the annual meeting, Crabb said that any closure of the Broken Hill Pty Co Pty Ltd's Newcastle steel plant would not affect Simsmetals operations.

"Westpac Banking Corp Ltd is expected to report on Tuesday that its net profit growth was reined back to a slower 10 percent in the 1995/96 year by an increasingly competitive home loan sector and a slower economy. Analysts said the main focus in the results would be on how that increased competition and recent sharp cuts in home lending margins would hit Westpac's profits in 1996/97. ""You're really only going to have a full impact for the year ending September 1997,"" Morgan Stanley banking analyst John Hobson said of the sliding home loan margins.   ""There'll start to be a moderating influence (on profits) which intensifies throughout 1997,"" he said. ""You'll see fairly cautious statements being made at the briefing."" The median forecast in BZW's BARCEPs analyst survey is for a net profit before abnormals for the year to September 30, 1996 of A$1.12 billion, up about 10 percent from A$1.02 billion in 1994/95. This compares with a 44 percent rise between 1993/94 and 1994/95. ",BernardHickey
"World yeast and spices giant Burns Philp &amp; Co Ltd announced a hefty loss for the 1995/96 year on Wednesday after taking some heavy hits in a vicious U.S. price war and Asian expansion. Burns Philp, the western world's largest fresh bakers' yeast maker and second largest spice maker, posted a net loss of A$61.8 million (US$48.8 million) for the year to June 30. This came after abnormal losses of A$136.6 million, due largely to rationalisation of its U.S. operations and other costs linked to a spice price war with the world's largest spice maker, McCormick &amp; Co Inc of the United States. Burns Philp managing director Ian Clack said the tussle for market share in the United States appeared to have abated, but the cost of paying supermarkets for premium shelf space during the two-year war had to be written off. The writing off of these costs, known as slotting contracts, made up A$33.9 million of the abnormal losses. ""Recent slotting contracts have been negotiated with improved margins, indicating that market conditions are returning to a more acceptable level,"" Clack said. He said Burns Philp had increased its U.S. spices market share by one percentage point to 16 percent after the war while McCormick's share had risen 1.5 points to 34 percent. Other U.S. spice makers lost market share, he said. Burns Philp has 16 percent of the western world's yeast market and seven percent of its spice market. Costs incurred during an Asian expansion also boosted Burns Philp's losses. ""The result was also affected by the cost of expanding our presence in Asia together with plant upgrade costs in China and India,"" Clack said. The result surprised brokers and analysts, who had expected large abnormal losses but were disappointed by a lower pre-abnormals net profit as well. Net profit before abnormal items fell to A$74.8 million, down from the A$104.1 million posted in 1994/95 and down on most analysts' forecasts of about A$80 million. Burns Philp's decision not to post a final dividend also upset investors. ""A woeful result and passing their dividend hasn't helped,"" said Jim Tredenick, senior dealer at broking house Nevitts Ltd. Burns Philp's share price closed down 10 cents at A$1.95. Analysts also said there may be more abnormal losses to come, particularly in the value of intangibles like goodwill. ""It was a bad result...the issue is whether or not they've completely taken the knife to intangible valuations, that's the area where there could be some further writedowns,"" one Sydney analyst said. ""They didn't take much off the intangibles. That (the A$30.7 million of intangible writedowns) hardly made a dent in it,"" another Sydney analyst said. Clack said the company had taken the most conservative measure of intangible values it could and did not expect any more abnormal losses in the current year. He said an earnings turnaround was possible in 1996/97. ""In most markets we are seeing some improvement in the first two months of the year. There's been an improvement in demand, particularly in the North American markets."" (A$1 = 79 U.S. cents) ",BernardHickey
"Australia's second-largest bank, Westpac Banking Corp Ltd, announced a 19.5 percent rise in net profit for the 1995/96 year on Tuesday, but warned that fierce competition would flatten profits in the year ahead. ""Everywhere you look and in every market we're in there's a lot of margin pressure,"" Westpac managing director Bob Joss told a news conference after the profit announcement. ""It will be tough to make a rise,"" he said when asked if profits for the year to September 30, 1997, would be flat. Westpac reported net profit of A$1.132 billion (US$890 million) for the year to September 30, 1996, up 19.5 percent on 1994/95. But this disguised a flat profit in the second half of the year and was boosted by a sharp drop in bad debt charges. Joss said competition from non-bank mortgage originators in the housing loan sector was a key factor pressuring margins. Mortgage originators such as Aussie Home Loans and RAMS Home Loans, who have snared 10 percent of the mortgage market from big banks like Westpac over the last two years by offering cut price home loans. Their entry into the market has dragged the big banks' home loan margins down from over 300 basis points last year to just over 200 points now. Joss said Westpac would look to boost its own mortgage origination programme to help compete against the non-banks and support its margins. Westpac has already launched one issue of securitised mortgages worth A$340 million, the first of the major banks to do so. Joss said Westpac planned to multiply the size of such issues in the current year. ""The real key for us will be to try to manage our balance sheet, have more assets off balance sheets, more securitising of lower margin assets,"" he said. ""We just did one near the tail end of the (1995/96) year, A$340 million, so we would expect to see quite a bit more in the year ahead,"" Joss said. Even then, Westpac would struggle to maintain its margins and would have to cut costs and increase efficiency to compensate. The bearish earnings comments and the detail of the result saw Westpac's share price close down 15 cents at A$7.05, despite the result being almost exactly the average of analysts' forecasts. Westpac is the second major bank to forecast flat profits in the year ahead because of increased competition. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia since May has been forecasting flat profits over the next year. These more sober forecasts signify the end of two to three years of sharp profit rises for the major banks as they recovered from hefty loan losses in the early 1990s and capitalised on a strong economy. A smaller New South Wales-based bank, St George Bank Ltd, echoed this new more subdued outlook for profits in its annual results also announced on Tuesday. St George reported net profit of A$148.3 million for the 1995/96 year, a rise of 9.4 percent. St George managing director Jim Sweeney said margin pressure meant it would be a challenge to improve profits in the first half of the current year. (A$1 = US$0.7880) ",BernardHickey

Bad debt charges fell to A$121 million in 1995/96, down sharply from A$330 million in 1994/95, a fall which Westpac said contributed about A$200 million to the 12 percent rise in pre-tax and abnormals profit to A$1.389 billion. Joss said competition from non-bank mortgage originators in the housing loan sector was a key factor pressuring margins.   Mortgage originators such as Aussie Home Loans and RAMS have taken over 10 percent of the mortgage market from the big banks including Westpac over the last two years, dragging home loan margins down from over 300 basis points to just over 200 points.

When asked how much more than A$340 million, he said: ""Multiples of A$340 million."" Even then, Westpac would struggle to maintain its margin.   Westpac reported in its accounts for the year that the group's net margin had fallen to 370 basis points over the whole 1995/96 year, down from 380 basis points over 1994/95. Joss said the fall was already apparent towards the end of the year to September. ""At the tail end of the year, it's actually less than what you would have seen for the year,"" Joss said. He acknowledged Westpac would find it difficult to keep that margin from falling from 370 points. Given the margin pressure, Westpac would continue to focus on increasing transaction and other fees to compensate.   ""In such an environment, maintenance of overall net earnings growth will depend increasingly on attaining improvements in fee income generation, particularly non lending-related fees and on improved efficiency of operations,"" Joss said in an earlier statement. He told the news conference he would like to see Westpac's efficiency ratio, which measures expenses to income, fall below 60 percent from the 62.6 percent evident in 1995/96.   This ratio worsened during the year from 60.6 percent in 1994/95, due largely to the costs of acquiring and restructuring the Western Australian-based Challenge Bank and Trust Bank of New Zealand. Joss said rationalisations throughout Westpac over the next two years would help to lower costs, improve efficiency and therefore compensate somewhat for the slimmer margins. The bearish comments from Joss helped Westpac close 15 cents lower at A$7.05. -- Bernard Hickey -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1812 ",BernardHickey
"Airline giant British Airways Plc (BA) is unlikely to hike its airfares by the full three percent agreed to last week by the world's airlines, BA chairman Sir Colin Marshall said on Monday. The world's airlines, desperate to hold up their profits in the face of a 40-percent surge in fuel prices this year, said in Geneva last week through the International Air Transport Association (IATA) that they proposed to raise passenger fares by three percent. Marshall told reporters after a luncheon address in Sydney that BA was not as badly affected as some other airlines because of the strength of sterling against the U.S. dollar. ""You also have to bear in mind that the impact for individual carriers does depend on exchange rates in that all aviation fuel is priced in U.S. dollar terms,"" he said. ""So one has to watch what is happening to your own currency versus the U.S. dollar to see what the overall impact will be for a company,"" he said. When asked if the recent strength in sterling meant BA would therefore not pass on the full three percent agreed to in Geneva, he said: ""I think that's quite likely."" He said BA had increased its prices by only about one percent before the Geneva resolution because of the strong currency. ""The pound has been relatively strong against the dollar and that's why we only applied about a one-percent increase in price."" IATA, which has 251 member airlines, said in Geneva the proposed increase, which is subject to government approvals, would apply to fares from December 15. Marshall said the extent to which the three percent increase was applied depended on each individual carrier and how fuel prices changed through the northern hemisphere's winter. Many European carriers are pushing for a concerted move to lift ticket prices by up to three per cent, but Asian and North American carriers were believed to be reluctant to do so. BA reported earlier this month that despite strong traffic growth and greater productivity its first half operating profits were down 2.1 per cent compared with last year. Part of the drop, it said, was due to the extra US$84 million it had had to pay for fuel. Meanwhile, Marshall said he was confident the European Union would not thwart BA's plan to form an alliance with American Airlines, although he acknowleged it would take the two a long time to jump the various regulatory hurdles in front of them. ""I'm not worried about it because I don't think that that is likely to happen,"" Marshall said of a possible EU block. On Friday the European Commission (EC) said it had formally asked BA for details of the planned alliance. A report that the EC had said the alliance did not appear to be in the best interests of consumers pushed BA's shares lower earlier on Friday. ""There are so many precedents for similar events that have been allowed to go into effect, that to me it would be quite wrong if the European Union reached that conclusion,"" he said. ""I think things are all moving in the right direction, but it's just very slow,"" Marshall said of the regulatory process. ",BernardHickey
"Australia's largest retailer, Coles Myer Ltd, forecast a rejuvenation in its profit outlook at its annual meeting on Tuesday but failed to stop shareholders launching into a six-hour tirade aimed at Coles' directors. The prime target was former executive chairman Solomon Lew, who was re-elected as a director with the help of proxy votes after the floor of the meeting overwhelmingly rejected his re-election. Coles Chairman Nobby Clark, who was jeered when he tried to cut short debate on Lew's re-election, said Coles was seeing something of a rejuvenation in its businesses.

"The Brunei Investment Agency (BIA) on Tuesday bought a 13.4 percent stake in Macquarie Bank Ltd, removing the links between one of Australia's top four investment banks and its British founder. Macquarie said in a stock exchange statement just after the start of morning trading that the Brunei government-owned agency paid Lloyds TSB Plc A$151.7 million (US$122.8 million) for the stake. The purchase by the agency's Brunei Investment and Commercial Bank (BICB) from Lloyds' Hill Samuel &amp; Co unit makes it the largest individual shareholder in Macquarie. Macquarie Bank managing director Allan Moss said the bank had developed a good relationship with BIA and its senior management over the months it had taken to arrange the deal. ""We are delighted that they have become associated with the bank as a major shareholder, and we are confident that BICB will prove to be a constructive and long term investor in Macquarie,"" Moss said. The purchase ends Hill Samuel's 27-year direct involvement in the Australian investment banking sector. Hill Samuel set up what is now known as Macquarie Bank in 1969 before selling down its stake to 30 percent in 1985 and then down to 15 percent in 1993. Since then Macquarie, which now has 1,800 staff, has listed on the Australian Stock Exchange and is now one of Australia's top 100 companies. It has offices throughout Australasia and in China, Singapore, Malaysia, London, Munich, New York, Hong Kong, Indonesia and South Africa. Its asset base stood at A$5.17 billion on March 31, the end of its financial year. Macquarie also has more than A$20 billion in assets under management and has operations in corporate finance, sharebroking and in commodities, debt and foreign exchange trading. It posted net profits of A$93.2 million in 1995/96. Macquarie Equities ranks amoung the top four brokers in terms of turnover on the Australian Stock Exchange and had the biggest inflow of retail funds for management in the year to June 30, 1996. Macquarie chairman David Clarke told a news conference he was confident that BICB was a stable shareholder. ""By and large you only read announcements of them buying things and investing in things you don't read about them selling out of things,"" Clarke said. The sale of the Hill Samuel stake appears to remove from the market a convenient bridgehead for a takeover bid from another Australian bank.

"An inquiry into Australia's financial system has left open the option of mergers among Australia's big banks and takeovers of local banks by foreign banks in an interim discussion paper released on Wednesday. The inquiry, established by the government and headed by prominent businessman Stan Wallis, outlined various options for reform and was careful not to state its own preferences. But it said the key aim of any reforms should be increasing the efficiency of Australia's banks to compete globally and that new technology would transform the sector. Big banks such as the National Australia Bank Ltd have used the same reasoning lobbying for relaxed merger rules. The banks have said big bank mergers are necessary to compete globally and new technology such as the Internet and global competition meant such mergers would not cut competition. Policy set by the former Labor government has stopped mergers or foreign takeovers of Australia's four largest banks and its two largest insurance and superannuation groups. The current conservative coalition government has said this so-called ""six pillars"" policy will remain in place until it has considered the Wallis inquiry's recommendations, due to be delivered by the end of March 1997. ""The Inquiry sees as its key goal the identification of means to increase the efficiency of the Australian financial system, without compromising its safety and peformance,"" the paper said. Increased efficiency was needed to complete globally, to obtain the benefits of new technology and to increase investment returns, the paper said. It asked if competition and innovation could be stimulated by widening access to traditional banking activities through: * ""Allowing direct non-bank access to the payments settlement system"" * Better accomodating financial conglomerates * Allowing an increased range of institutions to provide a wider array of financial services, or * relaxing some of the ownership restrictions on financial institutuions ?"" The inquiry said it was also wanted any reforms to increase competition and asked in that context ""whether there are any public policy grounds for restrictions on foreign acquisitions in the banking or insurance industries?"" In discussing the details of how bank mergers might be approved, the inquiry said there was widespread consensus that banks should be subject to the same competition rules as other industries. Currently any bank merger must be approved by the government through the Treasurer and by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). This dual approval process does not apply in other industries.   ""In undertaking its assessment, the Inquiry notes its preference...for all sectors of the economy to be subject to a uniform set of competitionpolicy laws unless there is something sepcial which justifies different treatment,"" the paper said. The Inquiry said it would consider the following options for merger approvals, including; * keeping the current system of dual approval * having the Treasurer accept the ACCC's decision, or * narrowing powers over mergers in banking and insurance law It said there would be no need for a 'six pillars' policy if the Treasurers powers were removed or if he agreed not to excercise them. ""There was almost unanimous support that the 'six pillars' policy should be abolished,"" the paper said. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1812 ",BernardHickey

"Australia's wealthy baby-boomers are disillusioned with service provided by banks and believe loyalty is not rewarded, a survey released on Monday found. Those approaching retirement were also unhappy with the performance of their superannuation funds and were looking to move elsewhere wherever possible, the survey by forecaster BIS Shrapnel has found.   ""Australia's affuent boomers -- the demographic group owning the largest share of private wealth -- are distrustful of the performance and motivations of financial institutions, and yearn for a return to the days when customer loyalty was rewarded,"" BIS Shrapnel said in the survey titled ""Financial Services for the Affluent Boomers."" Those surveyed had assets worth over A$150,000, excluding the family home. The survey of 128 people aged over 45 in 14 seperate focus groups around Australia found they sought more individual treatment by knowledgable staff.   ""In particular those approaching retirement are more likely to equate good service with personal service and contact,"" BIS Shrapnel survey project leader Geoff Ludowyke said. ""They want to develop a relationship with one particular person within their banking branch,"" he said. The survey found that Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) was the least liked of all the banks, Ludowyke said. Respondents found the CBA slower, more unfriendly, more impersonal and less modern than the other banks, he said.   Westpac Banking Corp Ltd was seen as the next least-liked bank while the ANZ Banking Group Ltd and the National Bank Ltd were seen in another group in-between CBA and the credit unions, which were the most favourably received. Former building societies like St George Bank Ltd and Advance Bank Ltd, which are in the process of merging, were seen as similar to the credit unions. ""Among the major banks with the most negative comments were the Commonwealth and Westpac,"" Ludowyke told Reuters.   ""ANZ and NAB were in the next group while the credit unions were in another group out front,"" he said. The survey also found that rich baby-boomers did not believe that swapping pension funds would improve their returns. ""They intend to move away from superannuation,"" Ludowyke said. Law changes were also generating anxiety about superannuation, he said. ""Affluent boomers expect governments to continue to change the rules in a way that will benefit governments rather than contributors,"" he said. The survey also found that banks were perceived as greedy.   ""Reports of huge profits compound the resentment to bank fees and banks are believed to be primarily concerned with looking after their shareholders rather than their customers,"" the report said. ""Affluent boomers are particularly annoyed by new charges for ATM and EFTPOS usage.""

"The Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) rate cut on Wednesday is expected to further squeeze bank margins as competition has forced them to pass this cut on to their mortgage customers sooner than usual. The major banks have previously delayed passing on the effect of official rate cuts to their variable rate home loan customers by around seven weeks. They would, however, often begin lowering variable and fixed deposit rates immediately, providing a temporary widening of their margins.   Wednesday's rate cut has seen the major banks shorten this delay in passing on the rate cut to about five and half weeks. Analysts and some of the banks said increasing competition from non-bank mortgage lenders and the regional banks had been the major factor in this contraction. They also said they expected this gap to narrow further when further official rate cuts are made next year. ""The implication is a bit more pressure on margins,"" said ABN AMRO Hoare Govett banking analyst Michael Pulman. ""This all about competition,"" he said.   ""These competitive forces will end up contracting it down further, possibly down to 30 days,"" said Aussie Home Loans managing director John Symond. Aussie, the biggest of the non-bank lenders funded by mortgage origination, said on Wednesday it would cut its variable rate to 7.49 percent from 7.99 percent from January 28 for existing customers, a gap of 48 days after December 11. At the time of the last official rate cut on November 6, Aussie planned a gap of 46 days, which was lower than most of the banks.   In response to Aussie and competition from regional banks like St George Bank Ltd, the large banks have cut back this delay. National Australia Bank Ltd said it would cut its variable mortgage rate to 8.25 percent from 8.75 percent from January 23 for existing borrowers, a gap of 43 days. After the last official rate cut NAB's gap was 54 days. In line with this trend, Westpac Banking Corp's gap has dropped to 37 days from 41 days and Commonwealth Bank of Australia's gap has dropped to 48 days from 54.   The Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd has yet to announce any cut in variable mortage rates in response to the RBA's cut in the official cash rate to 6.0 percent from 6.5 percent. The biggest move in the gap came from St George, which reduced the time it would pass on the rate cut for its major variable rate product to 20 days from 55 days. St George has even said existing customers of its no frills variable rate product would receive the cut from December 18, a week away. This product provides 20 percent of its portfolio.   Overall the average gap for the banks who have cut their mortgage rates has dropped to 40 days after this rate cut from 49 after the November 6 cut, which was also by 50 basis points. There may, however,be a limit to how much further this gap can fall, analysts and the banks said. A new regulatory code on credit specifies customers must be given 30 days notice whenever their interest rates are changed, creating an artificial barrier both up and down. ""I think 30 days will about see it out,"" said Aussie's Symond.   Analysts said the banks may try other tactics to cushion the effect of this reduction in the gap, but that it would still further reduce already-bruised margins. ""It will have an effect on margins,"" said BNP Equities' banking analyst Linda Lyon. ""They'll do all sorts of other things to cushion the effect. They'll be trying to reduce their deposit rates as far and as fast as they can,"" said ABN AMRO's Mike Pulman. ""But there's obviously a bit of a squeeze there, particularly for those banks most exposed to the housing sector,"" Pulman said.   CBA is seen as the most exposed with about 34 percent of its assets in home loans, with Westpac next on 25 percent and NAB and ANZ on about 17 percent. The big bank's margins on home loans have already declined this year from about three percent in June to about 2.25 percent now. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1812 ",BernardHickey

""The continuing improvement in our performance reflects, in part, the successful rationalisation of our wholly owned businesses and strong growth from our CHEP joint ventures,"" Brambles Chief Executive John Fletcher said. ""CHEP USA, in particular, continues to justify our confidence in its long-term growth prospects in the region,"" he said in Brambles' profit statement. Brambles' net profit rose 120.2 percent to A$215.1 million (US$169.9 million) for the year to June 30 from A$97.7 million in 1994/95. The previous year's result was undermined by an abnormal loss of $112.3 million. Stripping away abnormals, profit for 1995/96 rose 15.8 percent to A$214.8 million, at the top end of analysts' expectations. Pre-tax profits rose 13 percent and 30 percent from Europe and the United States respectively, while Australian profits rose eight percent. ""Overseas profits grew at twice the rate in Australia and the trend is likely to continue,"" Fletcher said. ""In particular we expect further contributions from CHEP in Europe and North America,"" he said. Fletcher later told Reuters this strong performance from Brambles' non-Australian operations had encouraged it to actively look at further acquisitions outside Australia. ""You should anticipate some acquisition work in the Northern Hemisphere, but in businesses we already operate in here,"" he said, referring to areas like transport equipment rentals and records managements. Looking ahead, he said strong contributions from the United States and Europe should continue to offset soft Australian conditions and help produce profit growth. ""We haven't got an expectation that we will get too much help from this economy...for at least another six months,"" he said. ""But all in all we've got enough things going to see another (profit) increase for this year,"" he said. The result generally pleased analysts, who also pointed to the strong U.S. pallet operations as the main bullish note. ""CHEP USA is the outstanding area,"" said Macquarie Equities analyst Ian Myles. ""As long as they're saying positive things about CHEP in the USA then they'll be alright and there's a reasonable amount of momentum there,"" another Sydney transport analyst said.

"Australia-based transport, logistics and security group Brambles Industries Ltd said it was actively considering acquisitions in United States, Europe and Asia in the current year. Brambles chief executive John Fletcher told Reuters in an interview that Brambles would only look at acquisitions in areas where it had Australian experience. ""You should anticipate some acquisition work in the Northern Hemisphere, but in businesses we already operate in here,"" he said.   ""Anything new we'll do on home turf,"" he said. Fletcher repeated that Brambles was looking at participating in the privatisation of Australia's airports being carried out before June next year. Fletcher said the vehicle for airport investment would be Bramble's joint venture company, Australian Airport Services, formed with property and financial services company, Lend Lease Corp Ltd. Brambles would look at acquisitions in the Northern Hemisphere in the industrial services, waste management, equipment rentals and records management areas.   Earlier Brambles reported a 120.2 percent jump in net profit to A$215.1 million for the year to June 30, 1996. Before abnormals, the net profit rose 15.8 percent to A$214.8 million, at the upper end of analysts' expectations of A$208 million to A$214 million. Fletcher said the result would have been a bit ahead of brokers' expectations. ""It's a marginally pleasant result rather than a huge shock,"" he said. Strong growth in earnings from Brambles CHEP pallet business in the United States helped boost the results.   Fletcher said the Australian economy, which provides the bulk of Bramble's earnings, remained flat and was expected to remain so for some time. ""We haven't got an expectation that we will get too much help from this economy ... for at least another six months,"" he said. The U.S. economy remained strong while Europe and Britain were flat, he said. ""But all in all we've got enough things going to see another (profit) increase for this year,"" he said.   Profits from Brambles overseas operations grew at twice the rate of those from local economies and this trend was likely to continue. This continued overseas growth would however affect the allocation of franking credits on dividends. ""The continuing growth expected in overseas earnings meant that the company would need to reduce moderately the level of franking of dividends declared on 1996/97 earnings,"" Fletcher said in an earlier statement. Recipients of franked dividends receive tax credits for Australian company tax already paid by the companies involved.   Brambles posted a 35 cents per share fully franked final dividend for 1995/96, up from a 33 cents per share final dividend in 1994/95. The total dividend rose to 69 cents per share from 65 cents. Earnings per share rose to 97.6 cents from 84.8 cents. Brambles' shares were down five cents at A$18.80 at 3.40 p.m. (0540 GMT). -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800 ",BernardHickey
"Almost 300 students and workers from the islands of Kiribati were adrift in the central Pacific on Wednesday aboard a crowded charter ship crippled by a fire, officials said. The 1,000-tonne MV Maasmond appealed for help on Tuesday night after losing power through the fire in the engine room. It was found by a Royal New Zealand Airforce Orion rescue plane drifting about 800 kms (500 miles) east of the Kiribati island of Tarawa with 290 passengers on board. ""The Orion located it this afternoon and was told via radio that it's in no immediate distress and has enough food and water for five days,"" Airforce Squadron Leader Ron Irons told Reuters from the RNZAF's base in Nandi, Fiji. ""It has partially restored its electric power, but it has no wasy to start its engine,"" Irons said. An electrical fire in a switchboard in the engine room shut down the ship's electrical systems late on Tuesday, leaving the converted freighter without power and still two days sailing from the nearest land. The ship's charterer, Kiribati businessman Waysang Kumkee, said the MV Maasmond's insurers would pay for another ship to tow it back to Tarawa. The 64.5-metre (210 foot) Maasmond was chartered to carry 290 passengers, mostly Kiribati students and workers, and 400 tonnes of cargo to Christmas Island from Tarawa, Kumkee said. A tugboat was likely to take two days to reach the stricken ship and another two days to tow it back to Tarawa, he said, adding the passengers had plenty of food and water to last the four days. ""It's not a problem. If they run out they can easily borrow some of the cargo,"" Kumkee told Reuters by telephone from Tarawa, one of a group of coral atolls about 5,000 kms (3,000 miles) north-east of Sydney. The cargo included rice and tinned food. None of the passengers or crew had been injured in the fire and the only problem on board was likely to be boredom given the ship's video players were out of action. ""With no videos, they'll be a bit bored,"" Kumkee said. Most of the passengers were sitting or sleeping under canvas on blankets on the deck, he said. They would be reduced to playing cards and their guitars until their rescue, he added. The MV Maasmond is registered in Kingstown in St Vincent and Grenadines, according to the Lloyds List, and has had engine trouble in the past. In 1992, it underwent engine repairs for ten weeks after encountering cyclones on a cruise through the Pacific. ",BernardHickey
"Gaming and electronics group AWA Ltd said on Wednesday it wanted to buy up to 75 percent of the New South Wales government-owned betting agency, the Totalisator Agency Board (TAB), later this year. AWA managing director John Rouse told Reuters in an interview that the company was looking at the option of a major recapitalisation to fund such an acquisition, which has been estimated to be worth around A$750 million. ""It's clear that AWA has a strong interest in participating in the privatisation of the TAB,"" Rouse said.   He said the racing industry and AWA were looking closely at the model used to privatise the Victorian TAB, where the industry bought a 25 percent stake and 75 percent was privatised through Tabcorp Holdings Ltd. AWA was considering the option of a major capital raising to fund the outright purchase of a 75 percent stake through a government trade sale, with an offer of a portion of the stake to the public later on.   ""You could have a situation where initially the capital raising is funded by financial institutions and maybe AWA's existing shareholder base, but within a period a portion of what has been acquired would be floated on a broader basis to the public,"" Rouse said. The Labor government in New South Wales has yet to say publicly whether it would privatise the TAB, but is expected to announce within several months a plan to sell it either through a public float or a trade sale.   Bidders however wanted the government to give some concrete assurances about the tax and licensing regime a privatisated TAB would face. ""It's important that the parameters in terms of tax and licensing are cast in concrete for some reasonable time,"" Rouse said. AWA was aware of a desire within government and the wider public that the public be offered shares in any privatised NSW TAB at some stage, he added. ""We would be prepared to make commitments to the government that we would float it later on,"" he said.   Rouse said there was a feeling within government and the racing industry that a trade sale would be preferable to a float. ""There are those that are close to this issue in government saying if New South Wales wants to deal with this matter quickly, if the racing industry wants to establish its financial arrangements sooner rather than later and the government doesn't want the costs of a public float, than a tender needs to be the preferred approach,"" he said.   AWA's share price closed down two cents at 91 cents on Wednesday. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800 ",BernardHickey
"Dairy and fruit juice group National Foods Ltd said on Tuesday its reforms announced in July were now almost fully completed and the group was poised for above-budget profit growth in the next six to nine months. ""It's almost fully implemented,"" outgoing National Foods managing director Graham Reaney told Reuters in an interview. ""The real benefits start to emerge as people become more familiar with the new structures and clearly there'll be gains over the next six to nine months,"" Reaney said.   Earlier on Tuesday National Foods posted a 17.3 percent higher operating profit before tax of A$37.6 million for the year to June 30. Its net profit rose to A$15.05 million from A$10.77 million after an abnormal loss of A$7.89 million. Net profit before abnormals rose to A$22.7 million from A$19.2 million, against analysts' expectations of about A$23 million. National Foods said in announcing its results, earnings for July and August were ahead of budget and comfortably ahead of last year.   Reaney repeated that this meant that 1996/97 profits were likely to be higher than in 1995/96, but he would not say how much higher. ""But its clearly going in the right direction."" The reforms had created a more efficient distribution system for chilled foods, increasing sales coverage for National Foods' products, Reaney said. ""It's a combination of cost reduction and enhanced distribution, and looking at our beverage division, our flavoured milks are performing particularly strongly,"" he said. ""There are a number of areas that starting to perform a lot better for us.""   Reaney said the sale of non-core assets had also been completed and the company was now focused on extracting profit growth from existing assets. ""We would consider all businesses that we have today as core businesses,"" he said, adding, however, that he could not rule out future acquisitions. ""But the first objective to make those assets that we currently own work better, produce more profit, more cash flow."" Singapore's Camerlin Pte Ltd has about eight percent of National Foods and Hong Kong's Mingly Corp has about 10.4 percent of the company.   Reaney said he would not comment on shareholders' intentions or actions or whether either of the Asian-based investors planned any takeover or had brought on any board room reshuffle. He said he had resigned the managing director's position having worked for the company for five years. ""Five to seven years is a normal period for a chief executive and quite genuinely I do have other things to do,"" he said. ""I'm quite relaxed and if it wasn't an amicable arrangement I wouldn't be staying on as a non-executive director,"" he said on his last day in the job.   Reaney's replacement, Max Ould, was chief executive of Peters Foods until April and presided over the transfer of operations from Pacific Dunlop Ltd to Nestle Australia.

"World-wide Australian transport group TNT Ltd reported another annual profit slump on Wednesday, but promised the sale of its troubled airline and other reforms would produce strong profit growth in current year. ""We haven't got any numbers, but it should be quite strong relative to the position we're starting from,"" TNT managing director David Mortimer said of prospective profit growth, in an interview with Reuters.   TNT's net profit for the year to June 30 fell to A$9.84 million (US$7.79 million) from A$40.01 million in 1994/95 and A$105.05 million in 1993/94. Mortimer said a sharp drop profits from Australia's Ansett Airlines, 50 percent owned by TNT, and losses from its Brazilian operations and local general freight business offset good revenue growth in TNT's core operations. He said profits from these core activities of domestic and international time sensitive freight and logistics had grown 48.7 percent to A$165.3 million in 1995/96.   TNT had moved to excise these loss-making units and focus on profitable core activities, he said. ""We've dealt with the (Australian) LCL (Less Than Container Load) business -- that's been closed, and we've sold Brazil,"" he said. ""What's the saying ... when in doubt shoot it or fix it."" TNT would also look to sell other unprofitable non-core businesses, Mortimer said. ""We've got other non-core activities and to the extent that they don't perform then they will be vulnerable to sale,"" he said.   ""The inconsistency in our results has come from these fringe activities ... it's that volatility around the earnings base that says we have to concentrate on core activities and get out of the non-core 'riff-raff' if you like,"" he said. TNT announced earlier this week the finalisation of plans to sell its stake in Ansett to Air New Zealand Ltd for cash receipts of A$325 million. The other 50 percent of Ansett is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd.   TNT's remaining non-core activities include an airline leasing company jointly owned with News Corp, some shipping operations between New Zealand and Australia, a mono-rail in Sydney and some information technology assets. Mortimer would not single out any as potential immediate sale prospects, but said they were vulnerable while they were not making profits. He said the airline leasing firm, Ansett Worldwide, needed to have its capital base restructured before it could be sold.   Shareholders however took the profit slump in their stride, having actually forecast a slight loss, rather than a slight profit. Net profit before abnormals, but after preference dividends, fell to A$0.6 million from A$38.48 million in 1994/95.

"Australian investment and property group Lend Lease Corp and Thailand's Modern Home Co announced on Tuesday they would build a markets complex in Northern Bangkok that would be Asia's largest. ""The 160 hectare, A$1 billion (US$778 million) project aims to create a new industrial commercial and residential hub in northern Bangkok, anchored around what is currently being established as Asia's largest single agricultural produce and export market,"" Lend Lease and Modern Home said in a joint venture announcement. ""The joint venture brings together the local experience of Modern Home and Lend Lease's international resources and financial strength,"" they said. Stage one of the project, which was 60 percent complete and projected to cost A$700 million, was already processing 15,000 tonnes of produce a day and had parking for 25,000 vehicles. The complex, known as the Thai Markets project, would be located on the main northern road from Bangkok and be about 20 km from the airport. ""Located in a key location in North Bangkok, the Thai Market has been conceived to tap into the high growth agricultural and industrial sectors as Thailand emerges as the 'food bowl of Asia',"" the said. The complex would eventually include food processing facilities so produce from surrounding areas could be packaged and processed for export. The second and third stages, which would cost A$300 million, would include factories, retail outlets and homes to service the complex. ""There will also be a major discount retail and wholesale distribution facilities and shophouses,"" they said. Lend Lease's Asian unit, based in Singapore, would contribute up to A$100 million to the joint venture for a 10 percent stake initially, with that percentage changing as the stages progressed. The project is expected to take four years to complete. A Lend Lease spokeswoman said she could not say how the percentage would change. Modern Home chief executive Thanom Angkanawatana said the joint venture was a key step for his company. ""Lend Lease brings extensive experience, management skills and capital. Their international perspective will significantly strengthen the project and position future stages for the next upturn in the economy,"" Angkanawatana said in the joint statement. ""Completion of the adjacent Thammasart University and Asian Games complexes as well as continuing infrastructure investment in the area by the Thai government is expected to further benefit the project,"" the two partners said.

"Electronic payment systems company Intellect Holdings Ltd said on Tuesday its bid for Internet software firm Techway Ltd would allow it to launch a product for making secure payments on the Internet. Intellect, which helped pioneer EFTPOS (Electronic Funds Transfer Point of Sale) technology and systems in Australia, wanted to export Techway's software in conjunction with its own secure electronic payments systems, Intellect executive chairman Ross Leighton told Reuters.   Intellect already sold its EFTPOS hardware and software to 20 banks outside Australia and to five or six large banks in Europe, all of whom were investigating its use with the Internet. ""All banks are looking for greater service and lower costs and the internet is the way to do that,"" Leighton said in an interview. Finding a user-friendly and secure way of making payments and money transfers on the internet has become something of a holy grail for programmers.   Secure payments systems are seen dramatically increasing the volume of financial transactions made on the net, which are already growing strongly. Techway's Web Australia unit built the software currently being used for internet banking by Advance Bank Ltd, which is merging with St George Bank Ltd. Intellect announced late on Monday it would make a takeover offer for Techway Ltd in a counter-bid to a previous offer by Nova Pacific Capital Ltd. Intellect said it will offer one of its shares for every 2-1/2 Techway shares. The bid values Techway at A$4.9 million.   Techway, who had already signed a distribution agreement with Intellect, has recommended shareholders accept the bid. Leighton said the success of Techway's software on the Advance Bank site was a key factor in Intellect's decision to launch a takeover bid. Advance's Internet banking site is Australia's most successful and has been consistently rated amoung the world's top ten internet banking sites by The Money Pages, an Internet magazine that rates internet sites.   Advance Bank spokesman David Brown said the Techway-designed site had 10,000 regular customers who used the site for about 10,000 transactions a week. The site was picking up 150 new customers a week and each internet transaction cost the bank less than 10 cents, while an over the counter transaction cost about A$2.50, he said. ""The collaboration between Techway and Advance was a key for Advance getting the jump on our competitors,"" Brown said. Intellect's Leighton said Techway's headstart in Australia meant it had a good chance of becoming the industry standard for Internet transactions in Australia.   ""It has the ability to become a defacto standard in Australia,"" Leighton said. The marriage of Techway's secure transaction software and Intellect's EFTPOS hardware and systems would help accelerate the trend of convergence evident in recent years between debit cards, credit cards and EFTPOS, he said. ""As these different payments come together, you'll then see they'll be able to be more economically utilised over the Internet.""   Intellect's share price closed down three cents at 95 cents on Tuesday, giving it a market capitalisation of A$48.19 million.

"Australasian food group Goodman Fielder Ltd is expected to report a slightly higher annual net profit before abnormals early on Thursday, as firmer margins in some areas are seen largely offset by higher grain costs. ""I'll be looking for some margin growth, but also there's been some strong raw materials cost increases,"" one Sydney analyst said, adding he was forecasting a pre-abnormals net profit of just under A$100 million.   The median forecast in BZW Australia's Barceps survey of analysts was for a A$100.0 million pre-abnormals net profit for the year to June 30, 1996. Forecasts ranged from A$97.0 million to A$102.3 million, compared with the A$97.3 million profit posted in 1994/95. ""There'll be a big impact from the grain prices in the second half and going into the first half of this (1996/97 year),"" another Sydney analyst said, estimating extra grain costs of about A$60 million.   But analysts expected the cost of grain, a major input in Goodman's breadmaking and chicken operations, would ease back later in calendar 1996. The higher grain costs were likely to have been offset somewhat in the second half of 1995/96 by lower packaging and palm oil costs, some analysts said. Profit expectations are in a tight band in part because of Goodman's own comments about the result in early August. Goodman chief executive David Hearn said then that the pre-abnormal profit would be around A$100 million.   ""We're saying that there will be a small increase in pre-abnormal profit in the 0-5 percent range from last year and since we made A$97 million last year, zero to five means somewhere between A$97 and A$102 million,"" Hearn said. Goodman then also announced it would post abnormal losses of up to A$75 million in 1995/96, including a revaluation of its loss-making poultry operations. This would produce a net profit after abnormals of around A$25 million, Hearn said then.

""We haven't got any numbers, but it should be quite strong relative to the position we're starting from,"" TNT Managing Director David Mortimer said of prospective profit growth, in an interview with Reuters.   Mortimer said the non-core activities that slowed down TNT's earnings in 1995/96 were its general freight business in Australia and its Brazilian operations. ""We've dealt with the LCL (Less Than Container Load) business -- that's been closed and we've sold Brazil,"" he said. ""What's the saying...when in doubt shoot it or fix it."" TNT would also look to sell other unprofitable non-core businesses, Mortimer said. ""We've got other non-core activities and to the extent that they don't perform then they will be vulnerable to sale,"" he said.   One of those non core activities is TNT's 50 percent interest in airliner leasing firm, Ansett Worldwide. News Corp Ltd owns the other half. Mortimer said he had consistently said that Ansett Worldwide's capital base needed to be restructured to give it cheaper access to capital so it could compete properly. ""In its present structure, it's difficult for it to be optimised for News and TNT ownership because it needs access to capital at an effective rate,"" he said. News and TNT continued to look at ways of restructuring Ansett Worldwide's capital base before selling it, he said.   Ansett's GD Express operation based in Europe had turned around in the last year and was now going well, Mortimer said. He said the just completed sale plans for Ansett Airlines Mortimer said in the longer term, TNT aimed to get double digit revenue and earnings growth. ""Overall we'd like to do good double digit (revenue and earnings) growth, but we can't guarantee any of that,"" he said.

"Global media group News Corp Ltd must report a sharply stronger second quarter profit this Thursday or it will fail to achieve its 20 percent growth target for the 1996/97 year, analysts said. News Corp is expected to report a second quarter net profit before abnormals of between A$450 million and A$490 million, taking first half net profits to between A$735 million and A$775 million.   This compares with A$285 million in the first quarter and would be up 17 percent from the A$663 million posted in the first half of 1995/96. Analysts said strong receipts from the box-office hit ""Independence Day"" and firm U.S. television revenue would be the driving factors in the stronger result. They said the market was demanding that News put out a strong second quarter figure after a series of below-expectation results.   News' first half must be around 15 to 20 percent better if Rupert Murdoch's group is to achieve its August 1996 forecast of a 20 percent improvement in profits in 1996/97 from the A$1.26 billion achieved in 1995/96. ""They are going to have to get a move on in this quarter if they're going to achieve that 20 percent,"" said one senior News Corp analyst. ""If they can't get a decent rise for the quarter, people are going to panic,"" the analyst said.   Analysts said they expected revenues from Australian newspapers and magazines and the Ansett airline operation to remain weak in the second quarter. First Pacific analyst Lachlan Drummond said he expected Independence Day revenues to be the major factor in the stronger result. ""Television is also one area where there's room for some upside,"" Drummond said. He is forecasting A$474 million for the second quarter.   Analysts also said a good result was likely because News was due to give a big presentation to analysts and investors on February 24 in Los Angeles and would be reluctant to disappoint them immediately before that. ""That's got everyone believing that they won't have a bad result,"" Drummond said. The market would also watch the results commentary closely for a repeat of the 20 percent growth forecast.

"Most banks in the U.S. Midwest are expected to post third quarter earnings gains of 10 percent or more as the strong economy continues to generate loan growth, cost-cutting programs show results and credit quality remains reasonably sound. ""It looks like credit quality trends should hold up very well,"" said Michael Ancell, banking analyst at Edward D. Jones. He expects the banks he follows to have average earnings gains of 11 percent.   For most of the year, analysts who follow banks have been waiting to see deterioration in credit quality, especially in credit card loans. But while some banks, like First Chicago NBD, showed a higher charge-off rate in credit card receivables in the second quarter, a wider wave of loan quality problems has yet to appear, analysts said. ""I don't see large increases in (loan loss) provision,"" said James Schutz, banking analyst at Chicago Corp.   Many banks have also been aggressively cutting costs, which should help third quarter results. Analysts pointed to Milwaukee-based Firstar Corp as one bank that could benefit from an aggressive cost-cutting plan. Others point to banks that have been generating fee revenue, such as Northern Trust Corp and Norwest Corp, as also primed for strong gains.   ""Most people are working very hard at expense controls,"" said Thomas Maier, banking analyst at EVEREN Securities. ""I'm more in mind at looking more favorably at those banks that are strong revenue growers. Ultimately, you've got to sell product, in any business."" Another factor helping gains in earnings per share is stock buyback programs, with many banks aggressively repurchasing their stock. First Bank System Inc, which announced a plan earlier this year to repurchase 25 million shares, was seen by analysts as one of the most aggressive on this front.   Meanwhile, analysts said the 10 percent pace of earnings gains should continue into next year. ""Even though the credit quality cycle is not getting any better, it certainly is not getting any worse at any kind of a rapid pace,"" said Ben Crabtree, analyst at Dain Bosworth.

"Caterpillar Inc., the world's largest construction and mining equipment maker, Tuesday reported record third-quarter profits of $310 million, up 45 percent from $213 million a year ago. Sales jumped to $4.03 billion from $3.73 billion, while earnings per share rose 50 percent to $1.61 from $1.07. The results exceeded expectations on Wall Street and Caterpillar stock jumped $2.50 to $76.625 on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts had forecast profits of $1.34 a share, according to First Call, which tracks earnings estimates. For the first nine months of 1997, sales were $12.06 billion, up slightly from $11.86 billion a year ago, while profit surged to $980 million from $836 million. ""There really wasn't much of a sales increase but there was a tremendous bottom-line increase,"" Caterpillar Chief Financial Officer Douglas Oberhelman said in a telephone interview. Most of the earnings gain was due to improved operations, though some was currency related, he said. Profit margins rose to 25 percent in the quarter from 19 percent a year ago, primarily due to higher prices, stronger volume and the effects of a stronger U.S. dollar, Caterpillar said. Price gains were seen equally inside and outside the United States, Oberhelman said. Continuing improvements in manufacturing and essentially flat material costs also helped boost profits but were partly offset by an unfavourable product sales mix, the heavy equipment maker said. The sales mix in the quarter shifted more toward lower margin smaller machines, Oberhelman said, but he added that this mix shifts month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter. ""The thing that's encouraging is the gross margins remain strong,"" said Lisa Shalett, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc. ""It looks like the productivity gains they talked about in the second quarter are continuing"" Higher machine sales in the United States accounted for most of a 5 percent increase in sales volume in the quarter, Caterpillar said. But deliveries to U.S. dealer rental fleets fell from a year ago as rental inventories remained high, the company said. Machine sales in Europe fell due to declines in Germany and France, where the contruction sector remains weak, the company said. Sales in China, Japan, Australia and Latin America were up, while sales in Canada were unchanged and sales fell in the former Soviet Union. The company also said it expected 1997 sales to be up slightly from an expected record in 1996, while it expects 1996 profits to exceed the $1.14 billion reported in 1995. The current record for sales is $16.07 billion, set in 1995. ""Our preliminary outlook for 1997 is to slightly surpass the record levels achieved in 1996,"" Chairman Donald Fites said in a statement. ""We continue to see opportunities for solid growth in the vast majority of the global markets we serve, particularly in the fast-growing developing nations where infrastructure needs are greatest,"" Fites said. Higher industrial demand in developing regions, Canada and Australia are expected to offset slightly lower demand in the United States, Europe and Japan, the Peoria, Ill.-based company said. ""The outlook statement surprised me on two levels,"" Shalett said. ""It talked about slightly higher sales but not higher profit. I thought that was deliberate."" She also said that while sales gains outside the United States, Europe and Japan are expected to offset lower demand in those areas, ""it's not clear to us that it makes up for (those areas) on the profit side.""

"Struggling to stay on course away from its troubled past, Trans World Airlines Inc. now must find a new chief executive to take the helm of the troubled carrier.

""The last thing that the company needs now is more management turmoil,"" said one analyst, who declined to be identified. ""It doesn't have a strong or stable enough footing to deal with this kind of stuff."" Erickson's departure comes just four months after Chief Financial Officer Robert Peiser left the company.

""They're going to have to regain the confidence of Wall Street,"" said William Fiala, who follows the airline industry for Edward D. Jones &amp; Co., which is based in TWA's hometown. ""The only way they're going to do that is by coming up with a leader that's a proven turnaround (manager), or well-respected in the industry."" Erickson, who became chief executive officer in August 1994, brought the airline through its second bankruptcy reorganization and back to where it was buying new aircraft. But the turnaround is not finished, and higher fuel costs and the July 17 crash of Paris-bound Flight 800, which hurt confidence in the carrier and therefore its sales, have stalled the company's improvement. ""Erickson was the one who really steered them through the first half of the turnaround, but they still have a way to go,"" Fiala said. The company on Thursday reported a $14.3 million third-quarter loss and said its yield, a measure of fares, fell in the quarter. ""I don't know specifically the reason he chose to depart now,"" said Don Jacobs, chairman of the TWA Master Executive Council of the Airline Pilots Associaition. ""I think it's probably an impact of the third quarter financials and Flight 800."" TWA's unions have four seats on the company's board of directors and will play a part in choosing a successor for Erickson, Jacobs said, though he could not suggest possible replacements. ""We would expect that the board would replace Jeff with a top-notch airline manager,"" he said. ""As both employees and the stockholders in the company, we will be concerned and involved in that."" Industry experts said TWA's board of directors might have become impatient with the pace of the turnaround after seeing the third-quarter results. But they also quickly defended Erickson's record at the company.

Calls to Erickson at TWA's offices Friday were transferred to a public relations office, which said he was unavailable for comment. TWA Chairman Thomas Meagher did not return calls. Analysts said TWA's board would need to move quickly and that the next chief executive would need a good degree of independence from the board. ""Whatever they do to replace Erickson, they need a hands-on manager, not a messiah,"" Boyd said. ""In a situation like this, you have to have free reign. You can't have people behind you second-guessing every one of your moves."" Boyd said several managers at United Airlines might be interested in the job. He also suggested that former Alaska Air Group Chief Executive Raymond Vecci could be a candidate. Earlier this year, Erickson, who was criticized by families of the Flight 800 victims for the company's response to the crash, told students at Washington University in St. Louis that the aftermath of the crash was draining, said Stuart Greenbaum, dean of the university's business school. ""I can't help believing the crash just took a lot out of Jeff,"" said Greenbaum, who said he is a friend of Erickson's.

"Mercantile Bancorp Inc said Monday it could still make other acquisitions while it is completing its $855 million merger with Mark Twain Bancshares Inc. ""While this will be an active project for us beginning today, it doesn't mean that we don't have additional capacity to continue,"" John Beirise, Mercantile's group president in charge of mergers and acquisitions, said in an interview. Beirise noted that not all of Mercantile will be involved in the acquisition of St. Louis-based Mark Twain, so acquisitions in other geographic locations might be possible. He also said Mercantile has been an active acquirer, and so is adept at assimilating mergers. St. Louis-based Mercantile, with $18.2 billion in assets, currently has four mergers pending. The Mark Twain deal, announced Monday and expected to close in the second quarter of 1997, is an exchange of shares valued at $49.62 per Mark Twain share, based on Friday's closing price, the banks said.   That works out to 2.8 times Mark Twain's book value, a price Beirise conceded was lofty for banks in general. ""In general it is, yes, but not many banks earn 1.8 (return) on assets,"" he said. Mark Twain reported return on average assets of 1.82 percent in the third quarter, well above average for Midwest banks. Beirise said Mercantile was not considering its potential as a takeover target when it made the deal to acquire Mark Twain. Mercantile, the second largest bank holding company in Missouri behind Boatmen's Bancshares Inc, has been mentioned by analysts as an acquisition target for banks trying to expand their Midwest presence. Boatmen's agreed in August to be acquired by NationsBank Corp. Beirise said as long as the bank delivered value for shareholders, it would be a difficult takeover target.

As the largest bank holding company in Missouri behind Boatmen's Bancshares Inc, Mercantile is seen by analysts as attractive to banks looking to establish a presence in the lower Midwest. In August, NationsBank Corp agreed to buy Boatmen's Bancshares Inc for $9.5 billion. That deal valued Boatmen's at a pricey 2.7 times book value, analysts said. Mercantile's deal values Mark Twain at about 2.8 times book value, analysts said. The pooling of interests deal is worth $49.62 a share to Mark Twain shareholders, based on Friday's closing price, the banks said.   The St. Louis-based bank holding companies would have a combined total of $21.3 billion in assets. ""It's a pretty pricey transaction,"" said James Schutz, banking analyst at Chicago Corp. ""Mark Twain is a very profitable and a very attractive franchise."" Mark Twain reported return on average assets of 1.82 percent in the third quarter and return on average realized common equity of 18.49 percent, putting it in the upper echelon of Midwest banks, analysts said.   ""It's an in-market deal, which allows for a tremendous ammount of efficiencies, which is good for Mercantile,"" said Joseph Steiven, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. ""They're paying full-boat prices, but they're getting an excellent company."" But Schutz noted that Mark Twain already operates efficiently, and questioned how much more in efficiency Mercantile could wring out of Mark Twain. ""The question I would ask is how is Mercantile going to earn back this premium they're paying,"" Schutz said.   That question appeared to be in the market Monday, with Mercantile shares down 2-3/8 at 49-3/4 and Mark Twain up 3-5/8 to 46. Mark Twain chief executive John Dubinsky, who is slated to become chief executive of Mercantile's St. Louis bank when the deal is completed, indicated there were not likely to be wholesale job cuts when the two banks combine. ""Between Mercantile and Mark Twain as we sit here today, there are over 200 job openings,"" Dubinsky said in an interview. ""There will be some duplications, there will be some consolidation of job functions."" But ""quality"" individuals whose jobs are eliminated because of duplication will be able to apply for other jobs, he said, noting ""I would be very surprised if there was a large number of individuals that won't be needed."" Dubinsky also would not rule out the possibility of the combined Mercantile/Mark Twain being acquired. ""Banking is changing so rapidly,"" he said. ""One couldn't make any comment with certainty about the future."" --Reuters Chicago newsdesk, 312-408-8787 ",BradDorfman
"As the world's first Internet bank, Atlanta-based Security First Network Bank has had somewhat of an identity problem with potential customers. ""We get a lot of questions,"" Chief Executive Officer James Mahan III said. ""Are you real? Are you virtual? Where are you really?"" Part consumer bank, part software testing site, Security First opened its virtual doors a year ago this month. But now Security First plans to add actual doors, opening small offices in Atlanta, Cambridge, Mass., and Silicon Valley in California. ""I think we can more effectively market if we have a physical presence,"" Mahan said in an interview. Comparing his bank to discount brokerage firm Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Mahan said having the offices may give customers a sense of security, even if they never use an office. Security First's current location is on the Internet. The bank is one of five in the United States that operates directly on the Internet, according to the Bank Administration Institute. Federally insured Security First can be accessed at Website (www.sfnb.com), which brings consumers to a home page that looks like a bank lobby. Customers can reach their account anywhere they have access to the Internet, rather than being tied to a single terminal where they have finance software, like other computer banks. ""Our goal was to have a bank that was fully interactive, where an individual could see all his information,"" Mahan said. Most Security First customers have a money market account and a demand deposit account. Customers can open a checking account with as little as $100, an amount most choose to start to make sure the bank works, Mahan said. Customers can pay bills electronically, purchase certificates of deposits or acquire a Visa card. Security First is also hoping to offer brokerage products and first and second mortgage products by the end of the year. Funds can be accessed by automatic teller machine, and Security First absorbs interbank fees for using the machines. With limited infrastructure, Security First can offer higher yields, Mahan said. The bank was offering a six-month CD with an annaul percentage yield of 5.9 percent. Security First was spawned as an idea of Mahan, who was chief executive officer at Kentucky-based Cardinal Bancshares Inc., and his sister-in-law's husband, Michael McChesney, who was starting a security software firm. ""He educated me on the Internet for years and years and years,"" Mahan said. Mahan used the charter of one of Cardinal's thrifts, changed its name to Security First and used it to start the Internet bank. McChesney's, firm, SecureWare Inc. developed software that Mahan said has military-grade security. So far, the bank has not had its security breached, Mahan said. ""That doesn't mean that there haven't been a number of sophisticated attempts,"" he said. ""If you have enough money and enough time you can break into anything."" Outsiders agree that Security First has shown a record of being secure, avoiding viruses, data theft and other potential dangers of Internet commerce. ""They do use a level of security that the Pentagon reserves for its most secure and sensistive systems,"" said Paul Schmeltzer, executive vice president for network services at Southeast Switch Inc., the corporate organisation for the Honour Network, the fourth largest ATM network in the country. ""Is any security design totally foolproof or totally secure? Probably not."" That software and others developed for the bank is likely to be the prime money maker for Security First. Mahan admits that Five Paces Inc., Security First's software unit, will be the prime contributor to the company's net income. ""The bank is really a test site to use as a demonstration for potential customers of the software business,"" said Gary Craft, an analyst who follows the bank for Alexandria, Va..-based Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &amp; Co. Security First's stock is traded on Nasdaq. Security First has opened about 5,600 accounts. Most of its customers are male, between the ages of 25 and 45, with average income above $63,000 a year. More than 80 percent own their own home, attractive demographics for marketing. Security First has also attracted competition. This month, Atlanta Internet Bank opened for business. Unlike Security First, Don Shapleigh, chief executive of Atlanta Internet, says he does not plan to open any customer offices. ""I have the WorldNet. I have other ways to get out."" Federally insured Atlanta Internet currently offers its services to subscribers of AT &amp; T's WorldNet Services. Shapleigh also argues that Atlanta Internet is the first true Internet only bank, saying that Security First is really a software company. ""I'm not selling software,"" he said. ""I'm a banker."" Atlanta Internet, which is a service provided by a unit of Carolina First Corp. can be reached on the Internet at (www.atlantabank.com). ",BradDorfman
"Caterpillar Inc. said Tuesday it is prepared to unilaterally impose employment terms, effective Oct. 1, on employees represented by the United Auto Workers after declaring an impasse in talks with the union. The impasse revolves around the firings of some union workers before and during the 17-month strike against the Peoria, Ill.-based heavy equipment maker that ended in December without a new contract. Caterpillar is willing to have firings after the strike sent to arbitration, but not those before and during the walkout. The terms Caterpillar said it will impose at its eight UAW-represented plants in the United States include a pledge not to close any faciltities except the company's York, Pa., plant through September 2001, and job guarantees through that time period. Caterpillar has 31 manufacturing plants in the United States. ""We are taking this step to provide our employees with an added sense of security about their future, while giving Caterpillar the labor costs and the flexibility we need to keep jobs in the U.S. and keep our U.S.-made products competitive around the world,"" Caterpillar Vice President Wayne Zimmerman said in a statement. Other terms include a 19 percent increase in Caterpillar's supplement of pensions for retirees until they become eligible for Social Security, an average increase of 7-1/2 percent in pensions and a doubling of potential incentive pay, Caterpillar said. Caterpillar's UAW workers have been working without a contract since 1991. A 17-month strike against the equipment maker ended in December without a resolution of contract issues. The UAW said Tuesday it does not agree that it has reached a lawful impasse with the company that makes it necessary for the terms to be put into effect. ""This tactic is yet another attempt to subvert the collective bargaining process,"" UAW Vice President Richard Shoemaker said in a statement. The union said it will pursue the appropriate legal remedies if the company takes action to implement employment conditions without the existance of an impasse. One analyst said the impasse declaration by Caterpillar appears to be genuine, not just a bargaining ploy. ""I don't think this is really a bargaining move,"" said Barry Bannister, analyst at S.G. Warburg. ""It's just an obvious impasse."" He also said he did not expect the move to affect the stock, noting that strikers returned to Caterpillar several months ago without an effect on the company's profit margins. ",BradDorfman
"Corporate financing for a downtown Detroit sports stadium complex is in place and land acquisition nearly complete, Mayor Dennis Archer said Friday. ""We believe that we are very, very close in making it happen,"" Archer said at a news conference. ""If property has to be taken, by condemnation or eminent domain, we will move in a timely manner in the manner in which it will be needed."" Legislation pending in the Michigan Legislature could help facilitate the condemnation process, Archer said.   Archer also said a deadline of 1700 EST Friday for the Detroit Tigers baseball team and Detroit Lions football team to make a commitment to the $505 million stadium complex was flexible. Lions President William Clay Ford Jr. said after the news conference that Monday was the true deadline, as Wayne County voters will have to decide Tuesday whether to approve a tax on hotels and rental cars geared at raising $80 million for the complex.   ""We can't go to the voters without this,"" Ford said after the news conference, referring to a complete accounting of land on which the complex would be built. The owner of a parcel that houses the Gem Theatre appears to be the major holdout, officials indicated. ""The one owner is a big problem at this point,"" said June West, press secretary to the Wayne County executive's office. ""There's a price issue."" The owner of the parcel, Chuck Forbes, could not be reached for comment Friday. West said stadium negotiators and Forbes were meeting Friday. ",BradDorfman
"Olympic Financial Ltd said Tuesday it could reach a deal to sell the company by October. ""I would expect that the time frame hopefully would be sometime in October,"" said Warren Kantor, chairman of Olympic's executive committee, in an interview. He was referring to the process of its investment banker Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette considering strategic alternatives for the Minneapolis-based automobile finance company.   Olympic said Monday it has received an indication of interest from a potential buyer. Kantor said others have also expressed interest in the company since Monday's announcement. ""Effectively, what I believe is happening is due to the public announcement, those people who would go through a longer time frame... want to be sure (they are) not left out,"" Kantor said. He would not comment on the identity of any potential suitors, but said the first contact came from a company with investment grade credit.   A combination with an investment grade company could allow Olympic greater access to capital to expand its business, Kantor said. Olympic's credit is not investment grade. Olympic needs capital to expand technology as its business expands, Kantor said. ""We think that the circumstances of the company are such that it makes sense to consider offers in order to take advantage of our rapid growth and opportunities,"" he said, noting that access to capital could especially become an issue in the event of a recession.   While capital may be harder to come by in a recession, demand for loans from Olympic's customers, who essentially need their cars to get to work, would not wane much, Kantor said. Kantor would not rule out the option of remaining independent and slowing down its growth plans, but added that it was likely the company would receive an acceptable buyout offer. ""While we think it is likely that we will get offers that are acceptable, we're not going to accept (just) anything,"" he said. Olympic's loans serviced have jumped to $3 billion at the end of June from $1.5 billion a year ago and the company is looking to further expand into a somewhat higher risk loan category it refers to as Classic, Kantor said. Those loans net 16-18 percent rates, while 80 percent of its portfolio is made up of loans at about a 12 percent rate, Kantor said, adding that Olympic wants Classic loans to make up 50 percent of the portfolio by the end of the year. Kantor would not comment on analysts' estimates ranging from $25 a share to more than $30 a share as a sale price for the company. Olympic rose 2-1/2 to 26-1/2 Tuesday. --Reuters Chicago newsdesk, 312-408-8787 ",BradDorfman
"The newly appointed chief executive officer of Meredith Corp said Monday that the company was beginning to see prices for television stations peak and come down. That could lead to Meredith making an acqusiiton sometime in 1997, said William Kerr, who is currently president and chief operating officer of the media company. ""We are hopeful that certainly in the course of the next calendar year that we would see some action,"" said Kerr, who will become chief executive January 1.   In the next few years, Meredith, which owns seven television stations could acquire about five more, he said in an interview. ""I think it may be easier in calendar 1997 than in calendar 1996 to make an attractive acquisition,"" he said, describing attractive as a VHF network affiliate in the 10th to 40th largest U.S. markets. ""We'd like a larger market, but we think it's unlikely one will become available,"" he said. The Des Moines, Iowa-based company also publishes magazines including Better Homes and Gardens and Ladies' Home Journal.   He said Meredith will not seek publishing acqusitions, he said. Instead, the company plans to launch new titles, including Family Money magazine, which is expected to be launched in the first half of 1997. Due to consolidation in the magazine business in the 1980s and early 1990s, ""we do not think there are many acquisitions"" to be made on the publishing side, he said. Kerr said he did not see another major magazine launch by the time the company's fiscal year ends next June, but said one could be launched later in the calendar year.   He would not say what the next title would be, but said it would be compatable with the publisher's family focus. Publishing currently makes up about 54 percent of Merideth's earnings, broadcasting about 43 percent, with the rest coming from licensing, Kerr said. The company currently has two licensing agreements with Wal-Mart Stores Inc, and Kerr said other agreements are possible, both with Wal-Mart and other companies. But he also said a new deal is not likely to happen for 12 to 18 months. ""I think it is unlikely that we would have a major new deal to announce in this fiscal year,"" Kerr said. On Monday, Meredith said its board of directors appointed Kerr chief exectuive officer. He had been president and chief operating officer. Kerr, 55, will replace Jack Rehm January 1, though Rehm will remain chairman until December 31, 1997, when he plans to retire, Kerr said. --Reuters Chicago newsdesk, 312-408-8787 ",BradDorfman
"McDonnell Douglas Corp. stock tumbled Monday after the Defence Department eliminated the company from the race to build a new generation fighter jet that eventually could be worth $200 billion or more. The decision was a blow to McDonnell Douglas, the nation's second-largest defence contractor and a long-time leader in fighter jets, and could force it to restructure, seek a merger or become more acquisition-minded, industry analysts said. The Pentagon on Saturday awarded four-year contracts to Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. to develop prototype fighter jets for the early 21st century for the Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and the British Royal Navy. British and U.S. forces have announced plans to buy 3,000 of the joint strike fighter jets, with initial delivery scheduled for 2008. With potential export sales of another 2,000 jets and additional funding for development and support, the programme could be worth $200 billion to $500 billion over the coming decades, industry executives said. McDonnell Douglas stock lost $4.25 to close at $52.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was one of the biggest losers of the day. Boeing rose $1.50 to $93.25 and Lockheed Martin rose $1.875 to $95.625, also on the NYSE. John Modzelewski, an analyst at PaineWebber, said the decision could force St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas to seek acquisitions more aggressively to help build its business, or into a merger with another defence or aerospace company. ""Everything's back on the table,"" Modzelewski said. In the past year, McDonnell Douglas has been the subject of rumoured talks with Boeing, Rockwell International Corp. and Raytheon Co.. McDonnell Douglas has declined to comment on potential mergers and acquisitions. ""We have said we will look at mergers, acquisitions and partnerships that will grow our business,"" a company spokesman said. ""This will be something of a wakeup call,"" CS First Boston analyst Peter Aseritis said. ""It's a fairly sharp and dramatic blow to McDonnell Douglas and I would venture to guess one they probably didn't see coming."" PaineWebber's Modzelewski said, ""Without having the internal growth such as joint strike fighter would give them, they're going to have to grow through acquisition."" That could include Texas Instruments Inc.'s defence electronics business, which is for sale, according to published reports. McDonnell Douglas Chief Executive Harry Stonecipher said on Saturday the loss was a surprise to the company. ""Certainly in terms of the overall future, 10 years and beyond, it is a significant programme to us,"" Stonecipher said. But in a statement to employees Monday, Stonecipher noted the company's backlog of aircraft orders to the military at home and abroad and said it was pursuing other orders. The company has a $46 billion order backlog, a spokesman said. ""This decision does not mean we are out of the military aircraft business,"" Stonecipher said. McDonnell currently builds the Air Force F-15 fighter and the Navy-Marine F-18E/F as well as the C-17 military cargo plane. Both the F-15 and the F-18 are to be replaced by the joint strike fighter in the next century. PaineWebber's Modzelewski said McDonnell Douglas was likely to participate in the new jet fighter programme as a subcontractor, as politics will force the wealth to be spread. But despite its key role providing fighter jets for decades, the based company has failed to win a major role in any of the next generation of tactical aircraft. Already the smallest of the three major commercial jet makers, McDonnell said last month it would not continue to compete against Boeing and Europe's Airbus Industrie in the market for the biggest commercial jetliners.

"Dayton Hudson Corp., the nation's fourth-largest retailer, Tuesday reported higher third-quarter results, giving added credence to analysts' projections of an industrywide strong holiday shopping season. Women's retail chains Ann Taylor and The Limited also posted higher results. General merchandise retailers should post decent gains in November and December combined, said Howard Eilenberg, an analyst at Johnson Redbook Service, a unit of Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan Inc. ""It's going to be overall in the 5-to-5-1/2 percent increase range (over the previous year's sales). More importantly, the gross margins and the profits are going to look better,"" Eilenberg said. Dayton Hudson said it had a 164 percent increase in operating earnings for its third quarter ended Nov. 2. Results were aided by a strong performance at its Target discount stores. The Minneapolis-based retailer reported operating earnings of $116 million, or 49 cents a share, several cents above analysts' estimates. A year earlier it earned $44 million, or 18 cents a share. ""The key issue was a very strong performance from Target in all areas,"" said Saul Yaari, retail analyst at Piper Jaffray. Target's operating profit in the third quarter rose 82 percent to $213 million, and total revenues increased 14 percent while same-store revenues rose 5 percent, Dayton Hudson said. Meanwhile, Dayton Hudson's Mervyn's unit reported a 98 percent increase in operating profits to $64 million in the quarter, boosted by reductions in marketing costs, store expenses and headquarters costs. The increase came despite a 3 percent drop in revenue and a decrease in gross margins. ""Our third-quarter results reflect continued strong profit performance at Target and Mervyn's,"" Dayton Hudson Chairman Bob Ulrich said in a news release. ""While the holiday calendar is challenging, we believe we are well positioned for a successful finish to 1996."" The 1996 holiday season includes five fewer selling days between Thanskgiving and Christmas than a year ago. New York-based AnnTaylor Stores Corp. reported net income of $3.3 million, or 13 cents a share, after a $2 million, or 8-cent-a-share after-tax charge related to obligations under its former chairman's contract. That compared with $666,000, or 3 cents a share, a year ago. Columbus, Ohio-based Limited Inc. reported operating earnings of $88.4 million, or 15 cents a share, before gains from initial public offerings, compared with $69.1 million, or 10 cents a share, a year ago. ""Our much improved third-quarter results reflect performance gains and continuing momentum in certain of our women's and our emerging businesses"" including the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch business, Limited Chief Executive Leslie Wexner said in a statement. ""Consistent with our sales plan, we enter the holiday period well positioned, with overall inventories up 3 percent per square foot at retail,"" he said. Analysts agreed The Limited was well positioned for the key holiday shopping season. ""I think they're positioned for a decent Christmas,"" said Elizabeth Pierce, analyst at Stephens Inc. ""Inventories are conservatively managed."" Dayton Hudson stock rose $1.25 to $37.625, Limited rose 25 cents to $17.75 and AnnTaylor fell 87.5 cents to $20.50, all on the New York Stock Exchange.

"H&amp;R Block Inc. Thursday reported a big loss for the latest quarter, as its CompuServe online service posted a $58 million loss and became more of a headache to its parent. H&amp;R Block had a net loss of $74.1 million, or 71 cents a share, in its second quarter ended Oct. 31, compared with a loss of $8.3 million, or 8 cents a share, in the 1995 quarter. Revenues grew to $253.4 million from $221.0 million. Kansas City-based H&amp;R Block, the nation's largest tax preparation company, blamed the bad news mainly on losses at its CompuServe unit, the world's second-largest online service, which has failed to sign up new subscribers, especially in the United States. H&amp;R Block still owns 80.1 percent of CompuServe, after selling the rest of the stock in April in an initial step to spin off the unit. But plans to complete the spin-off were suspended in August after CompuServe reported poor first-quarter earnings and projected second-quarter losses. Just nine months ago, shareholders and analysts were pushing for a spinoff, arguing that CompuServe's value was being held back by H&amp;R Block's staid tax business. Now they want a spinoff because the online services provider is weighing on H&amp;R Block's performance. ""The business model changed for CompuServe in a fairly dramatic way and now CompuServe's valuation is clearly holding back H&amp;R Block's valuation,"" said Martin Romm, analyst at CS First Boston. ""How quickly things change,"" said Dennis Hudson, analyst at George K. Baum. ""What happened was a whole lot of competition came in (to the online market.) The market became saturated before people expected."" Analysts said H&amp;R Block was waiting for CompuServe's new business strategy announced Thursday -- focusing on the corporate market rather than home users -- to push the unit toward profitability before the spinoff is completed. H&amp;R Block also cut its quarterly dividend to 20 cents a share from 32 cents, a move that it had previously said would occur after the spinoff was completed. ""Even though the separation has not been completed, the board decided such action was prudent at this time because CompuServe is not adding to the company's profitability,"" said Frank Salizzoni, H&amp;R Block's president and chief executive officer and CompuServe's chairman. ""In taking this action today, the board is indicating it anticipates the separation of CompuServe."" Both Romm and Hudson said they continue to rate H&amp;R Block stock as a buy and stressed that there was nothing wrong with the company's core tax business. The company said its Tax Services unit reported a pretax loss of $42.2 million in the second quarter, up $6.9 million a year ago. ""This year's deeper second quarter loss in these core businesses is in large part a result of the company's investments to expand its office network and roll out new products,"" Salizzoni said. ""They're making these investments primarily in new stores that are absorbing costs primarily without any commensurate contribution in revenue,"" Romm said, noting that the tax season does not begin until early next year. H&amp;R Block stock fell 37.5 cents to $28 on the New York Stock Exchange. CompuServe lost 93.75 cents to $10.6875 on Nasdaq. ",BradDorfman
"Just nine months ago, shareholders and analysts were pushing for H&amp;R Block Inc to spin off its CompuServe unit, arguing that the unit's value was being held back by H&amp;R Block's staid tax business. On April 19, H&amp;R Block began that process with a public offering of about 20 percent of CompuServe Corp. Analysts are still looking for the spinoff to be completed, but now the focus is on the sagging fortunes of the online service which is weighing on H&amp;R Block's performance.   ""The business model changed for CompuServe in a fairly dramatic way and now CompuServe's valuation is clearly holding back H&amp;R Block's valuation,"" said Martin Romm, analyst at CS First Boston.

Kansas City-based H&amp;R Block said the larger loss was primarily due to CompuServe's $58 million second quarter loss. H&amp;R Block still owns 80.1 percent of CompuServe.   ""How quickly things change,"" said Dennis Hudson, analyst at George K. Baum. ""What happened was a whole lot of competition came in (to the online market.)

"Dutch bank ABN AMRO Holding NV said Friday it agreed to pay $1.9 billion to acquire Standard Federal Bancorp, which owns the seventh-largest savings bank in the United States and the biggest in Michigan. ABN AMRO, which already has a U.S. banking arm, the LaSalle group, said it was offering $59 a share for Standard Federal, a bank holding company with $15.5 billion in assets based in Troy, Mich. SFB owns Standard Federal Bank, a large home mortgage lender in Michigan that operates about 180 bank branches and 11 home lending centres. It also operates a wholesale mortgage banking business. Despite the offer, SFB stock fell after running up sharply in recent days on takeover speculation. Some investors were disappointed the price was not higher, analysts said. ""All the people were really speculating yesterday that it was a lot higher are selling today because they're disappointed,"" said Tony Howard, analyst at Olde Discount Corp. SFB stock lost $1.625 to $56.375 in active trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Standard Federal chief lending officer Garry Carley said at a news conference that ABN AMRO had made the highest bid for the bank among several serious suitors. ""We had others who expressed strong interest in the bank,"" Carley told reporters. ABN AMRO, the Netherlands' leading bank, said it would issue $750 million in preferred stock to help fund the acquisition, its biggest to date. It said it would issue the shares through a U.S. subsidiary, ABN AMRO North America Inc. Formed in a 1990 merger, ABN AMRO already is the biggest foreign bank in the United States. Its LaSalle group has 130 branches and 7,750 staff members, mainly in the Chicago area. The agreement marks ABN AMRO North America Inc.'s sixth acquisition in three years and is likely to be the last for a while, ABN AMRO North America Chief Executive Officer Harrison Tempest said at a news conference. ""We're out of the acquisition business for some time now,"" Tempest said. When asked how long before it might make another deal, he said, ""probably two years."" The combined banks will also be the eighth largest mortgage originator in the United States, ABN AMRO said. ""It gets us into the league we want to be in mortgage servicing and mortgage origination,"" Tempest said. SFB employs about 4,000 people and serves 1 million clients in Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana. ABN AMRO said Standard Federal's banks will continue to operate under the Standard Federal name and there would be ""significant cost savings"" following the deal. While saying no jobs would be cut initially, both companies said some job cuts were likely eventually as administrative functions and some branches were consolidated. With Standard Federal, ABN AMRO North America will have the second largest deposit base in the Chicago market. Analysts said recent changes in U.S. banking law that will level the playing field between thrifts and banks should help speed other acquisitions of savings and loans. ""I think you're going to see an increased level of activity, both in banks acquiring thrifts and thrifts acquiring thrifts,"" said Jonathon gray, analyst at Sanford Bernstein &amp; Co. ABN AMRO said it had reached agreement with Standard Federal's board, but the deal still needed the approval of its shareholders and supervisory authorities. The acquisition was expected to be completed by mid-1997, ABN said, adding that the deal would contribute to its earnings. ",BradDorfman
"Shoppers lined up outside stores Friday, some arriving before dawn to get an early start on the holiday shopping season. The day after Thanksgiving is traditionally one of the busiest days of the year for retailers and the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season, the make-or-break time for many retailers. With consumer confidence high and employment strong, analysts are generally expecting sales gains of about 5 percent over last year's weak sales growth. The crunch is especially tight this year, since there are five fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. ""The money's there. The confidence is there. The jobs are there. The goods are there and the pent-up demand is there,"" said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Primark Decision Economics. Sinai forecast sales growth of 4.5 percent for November and December, compared with 2.9 percent gains a year ago. Shoppers also were there, with many retailers offering early bird sales to entice them. Roni Campos lined up outside the door of the Wal-Mart at first Colony Mall in Sugarland, Texas, a suburb of Houston, at 6:30 a.m. ""You should have seen Wal-Mart. They had a 13-inch television on sale for $99, and people were fighting for those TVs. Arms were flying, and people were just pulling those things off the shelf,"" she said. Stephanie Foster, of Richmond, Texas, was shopping for baby gifts in Mervyns California, a Dayton Hudson Corp. store chain. ""They had a line outside Target of at least 200 people,"" said Foster, who began her shop-a-thon this year at 5 a.m., shopping list in hand. ""I started out with a list of what everybody wanted and what time every store opened."" As one of the first customers through the door at Target, she was handed a bag with treats, juice, coupons and mints. ""I came here for a 64 bit Nintendo (for my granddaughters) and they had 40 in stock, but I ended up with two bags of Christmas presents,"" Rosalee DiGregorio said at the Menlo Park Mall in Edison, N.J. Other items that were expected to be hot this year are those related to the movies ""101 Dalmatians"" and ""Space Jam,"" said Tracy Mullin, president of the National Retail Federation. Barbie dolls from Mattel Inc. are also expected to be hot sellers, especially Holiday Barbie. ""Believe it or not, Barbie still has legs,"" Mullin said. The federation is forecasting holiday sales will rise about 6 percent over last year, reaching about $460 billion. While the the day after Thanksgiving attracts traffic and media attention, actual sales for retailers tend to come later in the holiday season. ""This whole weekend only accounts for 8 percent of purchasing,"" said John Konarski, vice president of research for the International Council of Shopping Centers. Susan Eich, a spokeswoman for Dayton Hudson, said sales volume the day after Thanksgiving is typically three times the retailer's normal sales. That day and the Saturday before Christmas are typically the company's busiest days. Filene's Basement Corp.'s flagship store in downtown Boston opened at 7 a.m. and was packed with shoppers by 7:30. Filene's Basement Chief Executive Samuel Gerson said the cold weather and a late Thanksgiving were making for a busy season. At the Falls, a mall near Miami, a small fire on a utility pole nearby cut off power to the complex for about an hour Friday morning. ""We actually ran registers, but off power. Everyone was doing it by hand, doing it by candle light,"" said a spokeswoman for the Bloomingdale's store at the mall. Bloomingdale's is owned by Federated Department Stores Inc.. Norm Allen, head of customer services at the Glendale Galleria in suburban Los Angeles, said the 280-store complex opened at 8 a.m. with about 100 shoppers in line to enter. ""This is going to be a good year. Our volume sales are already up 8 to 10 percent over last year at this time,"" he said. Apparel and soft goods were expected to lead sales nationwide, while analysts and retailers expect tough competition and a lack of major new items to pressure sales at elctronics stores. ""We'll provide an array of holiday sales,"" said John Costello senior executive vice president of marketing for Chicago-based Sears, Roebuck and Co.. ""Our sales are comparable to last year."" ",BradDorfman
"From free gift wrapping and valet parking to sweepstakes and private scheduled visits with Santa, retail malls are pulling out the stops to attract customers during the key holiday season. So far their efforts, as well as a strong economy, appear to be yielding results, as mall operators said they saw double-digit sales increases on Black Friday, the name retailers have given to the day after Thanskgiving. ""I think overall, consistently across the board, we're seeing sales up anywhere from high single digits to low double digits for the day,"" said Robert Michaels, president of General Growth Properties Inc., which owns and operates 120 retail centers across the country. Traffic patterns varied at different malls, with some reporting traffic up by close to 10 percent, while others saw traffic flat. But unlike last year, when there were many window shoppers, this year, people were buying. ""Everyone was browsing last year,"" said Sarah Liddle, associate marketing director of Newport Centre Mall, in Jersey City, N.J. ""Everyone was a little skeptical about what they were going to buy. Yesterday, it was unbelievable how many (shopping) bags were going through this mall."" That appeared to be the case throughout the country, according to Billie Scott, spokeswoman for Simon DeBartolo Group Inc, which owns Newport Centre and owns or has an interest in 185 properties, most of them malls and retail centers. ""For the most part, (according to) the people I talked to, traffic was at last year's level or above, but I guess the big difference is people were buying,"" she said. The publicly traded companies that own many malls -- and are known as real estate investment trusts (REIT) -- do not have as much of their revenue directly generated during the holiday shopping season as retailers. But a portion of rents are based on a percentage of sales, and the season will also help set rents in the future. ""The high sales in the fourth quarter justify the rent the rest of the year,"" said Lee Schalop, an analyst who follows REITs at J.P. Morgan Securities. To attract shopppers, malls offer features ranging from free gift wrapping to giveaways including $1,000 shopping sprees. At the Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg, Illinois, a northwest suburb of Chicago, Santa is available for five-minute prescheduled visits during the hour before the shopping center opens. Woodfield is owned by Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Taubman Centers Inc., which also said sales appeared strong to kick off the holiday shopping season. ""Everything we're hearing is positive,"" said Taubman spokeswoman Karen Mac Donald. ""Everyone is saying they had a good day yesterday. They were up."" At the Paramus Park mall in Paramus, N.J., prizes are being given away each week, with a grand prize of a trip to New York and dinner with the Rockettes. ""It's an effort to distinguish ourselves,"" said Kathy Lickteig, spokeswoman for Columbia, Maryland-based Rouse Co., which owns Paramus Park. ""At this time of the year, it is very important to have something special to attract shoppers."" But while services are a factor in attracting shoppers, mall owners said having the best stores is the key for bringing shoppers in to a mall. ""Number one, it does come down to having the right shops,"" said General Growth's Michaels. Mall operators said the stronger economy and the fact that there are five fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas may have helped prompt more shopping Friday. In fact, many operators said they have had promotions earlier this season because of the shorter shopping period, with some starting as early as Veteran's Day. Heidi Holwerda, vice president of marketing for Muskegon, Michigan-based Horizon Group Inc., an outlet mall operator with 36 centers, said her company began coordinated sales Nov. 10. ""As a result, we've seen some pretty significant increases in November in regard to traffic,"" she said, noting that traffic was up 10 percent in centers that the company has owned for at least a year.

"A brisk start to holiday shopping should help retailers post solid sales gains for November and make this season merrier than last year for the nation's store chains. But quirks in the calendar, with a later Thanksgiving this year, and some retailers tallying sales differently than others, could obscure overall results for November. Industry analysts said they expect sales at stores open at least a year to rise 2.5 percent to 4.0 percent overall in November, with clothing continuing to be a strong contributor, as it was in October. Most retailers report November sales on Thursday. ""We think the majority of companies are going to be on or above plan for the month of November, with good inventory levels,"" said Harry Ikenson, retail analyst at Rodman &amp; Renshaw Inc. ""We think the promotional level for Thanksgiving was high, but probably no higher than last year."" With discounts and markdowns no higher and in some cases lower than last year, and inventories being managed tightly, profit margins should improve, helping to lift fourth quarter earnings, analysts said. ""On balance, good business now is going to translate into decent earnings,"" said Dean Ramos at Dain Bosworth Inc. Ramos said his index of sales could be one to two points higher than the 3.1 percent rise reported last year and that the trend should continue through December. ""Absent some sort of event that shakes the consumer you should see good retail sales"" in December, he said. Holiday sales are crucial to retailers who typically earn a quarter or more of the year's profits during the season, analysts said. Steady economic growth and low unemployment have helped boost sales so far, and store chains should also benefit from easy comparisons with weak results a year ago. Consumers got off to a fast start on their holiday shopping after Thanksgiving, analysts said. Retail consumer spending in the post-Thanksgiving weekend rose 4.3 percent from a year ago, according to TeleCheck Services, which tracks check-writing volume. Overall, same-store sales rose 2.1 percent, TeleCheck said. Several department store operators were expcted to be among the winners when sales are reported on Thursday. Rodman &amp; Renshaw's Ikenson said he expected J.C. Penney Co. Inc. and May Department Stores Co. to be above expectations, with Penney's same-store sales up 7.5 percent to 8 percent and May's up 6 percent to 7 percent. Federated Department Stores Inc. should be up 7 percent to 9 percent, with gains in all its segments, he said. He also sees speciality retailer Paul Harris Stores Inc. up 15 percent to 17 percent, but Charming Shoppes Inc. slightly below expectations with a gain of 5 percent. Dean Witter analyst Patrick McCormack said in a research report he expected sames store sales to be up 3 percent in the month for the firm's index of 44 companies. He also saw JC Penney, May, and Federated above expectations, as well as Sears, Roebuck and Co. Sears was forecast by analysts to post a smaller-than-expected decline of 1 percent to 2 percent, which is due to a quirk in the company's sales reporting calendar that should help boost results in December. Sears Senior Executive Vice President John Costello said on Sunday that post-Thanskgiving sales appeared to be up across the board, from men's and children's clothing to Craftsman tools to fine jewelry. ""Optimism is up and it looks like consumers are responding to the short season by getting an earlier start,"" he said. Most analyts expect big-ticket consumer electronics to continue to be weak, though one saw some signs of a pickup in sales at the end of the month. ""Sears and Wal-Mart over the last week talked about a pickup in the computer area,"" said Michael Niemira, analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.

"Freight hauler Yellow Corp. said Wednesday it could cut 1 percent to 2 percent of its workforce as part of a restructuring of its largest operating unit, Yellow Freight System. Overland Park, Kan.-based Yellow Corp. said it has offered early retirement to 153 employees who are 55 and older and that it will announce layoffs in the first quarter. The company also said it will take an unspecified charge to fourth quarter earnings to cover expenses resulting from early retirement, severance and other costs related to a reorganization of Yellow Freight along geographic lines. Each geographic unit will have a group vice president who reports to Yellow Freight President Bill Zollars, while five officers at the central office will also report to Zollars, the company said. ""We are decentralizing responsibility for the business processes that touch the customer in an effort to be more responsive to their LTL needs,"" Zollars said of the less-than-truckload freight hauling business. ""All members of the leadership and management teams will be focused and incentive-based on four priorities,"" said Zollars. ""Those areas are customer satisfaction, improved profitability, revenue growth and operating safely."" Employees will have until Jan. 15 to make their decisions on whether to take early retirement, Yellow said. The number of layoffs will be determined, in part, based on the early retirement decisions, as well as the needs of the company as it reorganizes, a spokesman said. He estimated about 1 percent to 2 percent of Yellow's 24,700 employees could be affected. Analysts said the moves announced Wednesday were part of a strategy to improve performance at Yellow and help it regain market share. ""I think they need to focus on some labour productivity,"" said Corina Bergschneider, analyst at George K. Baum &amp; Co. ""Obviously, that needs to be done in line with their union contract and what can be allowed."" Yellow shares fell 12.5 cents to $14.50 on the Nasdaq system. ",BradDorfman
"First Chicago NBD Corp, while still open to acquisitions to expand its banking network, expects more retail branches to be cut over time as customers bank electronically or at supermarkets. ""As customers use more and more of those (channels), we've got to take away more of the brick and mortar"" branches, Verne Istock, chief executive, said in an interview Thursday. But don't expect First Chicago to make drastic cuts like the nearly 280 branches that Ohio-based KeyCorp said last month it would close or sell.   ""I don't think that's the approach we want,"" Istock said. ""I think that's pretty dramatic. I think you're better off to do it on an orderly basis from a customer satisfaction standpoint as well as an employee basis."" First Chicago has closed about 25 branches since the merger with Detroit-based NBD Bancorp a year ago that created what is now the ninth largest bank holding company in the United States, with $106.7 billion in assets. But at the same time, First Chicago could be looking to expand its retail customer base through acquisitions of other banks in the greater Midwest.   ""I have publicly said on more occasions than once that this organization does have an interest in expanding through acquisitions where it makes sense for shareholders,"" Istock said. This means any acquisition First Chicago does could only dilute earnings for a short time, if at all, he added. But Istock also said First Chicago has not had talks with Milwaukee based Firstar Corp, which has been mentioned as a possible First Chicago target for at least a year. ""We've had no discussions,"" he said of Firstar. He would not comment on other possible acquisition targets.   Istock also reiterated that an acquisition could be made outside of traditional banking as regulatory lines between banking other financial businesses are erased. Insurance, investment banking and securities banking are all areas that could be targets of traditional banks, he said. ""We're willing to consider any alternative that we think makes sense for our shareholders first of all and also for enhancing our customer relationships,"" Istock said. Analysts see First Chicago as having excess capital on its books, which weighs on a bank's performance. EVEREN Securities analyst Thomas Maier said the bank could have more than $2 billion in excess capital, while others estimate a lower amount. An aggressive 40-million-share stock repurchase plan has helped allay analysts' and investors' concerns about the excess capital. But making a purchase could also put capital to work. ""It's a way of in fact buying your stock back without having to go out in the market to do it,"" Maier said. First Chicago shares were up 5/8 at 55-1/2 Friday.

"First Chicago NBD Corp chief executive Verne Istock expects to see more job cuts at the corporate banking unit as the bank tries to turn around a business that has far underperformed the rest of the company. ""I suspect as part of our restructuring of the corporate bank there'll probably be reduced head count in the corporate bank, and there will be reduced capital allocated to the corporate bank,"" Istock said in an interview. He would not say how many jobs would be cut.   The corporate banking unit posted a dismal return on equity of eight percent in the first nine months of the year, compared with nine percent a year ago, with results this year weighed down by a $12 million trading loss. Overall, the bank reported return on equity of 16.9 percent in the first nine months of 1996. Now the corporate and institutional banking unit is being reshaped, paring back business lines to focus on those central to customer relationships.   ""I firmly believe that something that's chugging along at eight or nine percent can in fact be improved and we fully expect to get it up to that 15 percent or better return"" on equity, Istock said. Stockholders and analysts appear to accept Istock's argument that the corporate bank's results can only go up. ""You can criticize them, but frankly, it can only improve,"" said Joseph Duwan, analyst at Keefe Bruette &amp; Woods. ""I think they're taking a hard look at the businesses they're in in corproate banking.""   Istock stressed that increased revenue will come from the corporate bank by focusing on areas that will grow and cutting unprofitable areas. Already this year, the bank has said it will exit the institutional custody and master trust businesses, two paperwork-intensive lines that would have required major investment to gain significant market share. Istock also said the bank was trimming its trading operations, again focusing on instruments customers need.   ""I don't think we will have to have the entire (trading) product line or be on the edge of the envelope,"" Istock said. But he added that the types of trading vehicles customers need change. Istock said he was aware of the corporate bank's troubled performance before First Chicago Corp and NBD Bancorp merged a year ago, forming what is now the ninth largest bank holding company in the United States with assets of $106.7 billion. Meanwhile, First Chicago's stock hit a post merger high last week, before sliding in a sell off of most bank stocks this week. An aggressive 40 million share stock repurchase plan announced in October has helped boost the stock. But another area of concern to analysts is credit card chargeoffs, which jumped earlier this year. Istock said while chargeoffs will likely rise more as the economy slows, the business will continue to be a strong earner for First Chicago. ""It's a business we know, we understand and we plan to stay in,"" Istock said. He added that the bank is beginning to use its 13-million-customer credit card database to sell other products to credit card holders. First Chicago shares were up 1/8 at 55 Friday.

"The $9.5 billion proposed acquisition of Boatmen's Bancshares Inc. by NationsBank Corp. could spark a flurry of other mergers involving Missouri banks, which until last year were protected from outside buyers by state regulations. ""NationsBank just strolled into the Midwest and bagged the biggest banking trophy in the landscape,"" said Michael Ancell, banking industry analyst at Edward D. Jones &amp; Co. ""Whoever wants a big market position in the Midwest has to come in and grab Mercantile or Commerce."" St. Louis-based Mercantile Bancorp Inc., a bank holding company with $18.04 billion in assets, was seen by many analysts as the most attractive Missouri franchise in size after Boatmen's. Kansas City, Mo.-based Commerce Bancshares Inc., with $9.32 billion in assets, also could help a regional bank establish a strong presence in the lower Midwest, analysts added. ""It focuses more attention on Mercantile, Commerce and Roosevelt,"" said James Weber, analyst at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons. Roosevelt Financial Group Inc is a $9.33 billion asset-St. Louis based thrift. ""Now ... the most coveted bank out there is Mercantile,"" Weber said. Mercantile and Commerce did not return phone calls seeking comment. Among those seen as having an interest in buying in Missouri are Minneapolis-based First Bank System Inc. and Norwest Corp., Ohio-based KeyCorp and Banc One Corp., and First Chicago NBD Corp. in Illinois. Representatives of First Bank, Norwest, Banc One and First Chicago said the banks do not comment on rumors of possible mergers or acquisitions. KeyCorp, contacted by phone, would not comment.    With a presence in nine states and $41 billion in assets, Boatmen's was the prize in Missouri, where barriers to outside acquirers were brought down last year by a federal banking statute. ""Boatmen's was the plum of Missouri and was the plum of the central Midwest,"" Weber said. Talk that the Missouri banks were seeking inflated prices from buyers was seen as a reason a deal has not occurred sooner. But NationsBank's bid, representing a premium of 40 percent for Boatmen's stock, was large enough to get the deal done. ""I think Boatmen's was shopping itself, and everybody knew if you wanted to be the winning buyer here, you had to make the bid nobody would beat,"" Ancell said. But some analysts cautioned that other targets should not expect as large a premium. They also questioned whether NationsBank can recoup shareholder value with such a large bid for Boatmen's. ""I think initially some stocks will trade up on sympathy, but the wild premium NationsBank put on this deal here, I don't see a lot of other deals being done at this premium,"" said Michael Durante, analyst at McDonald &amp; Co.

"Firstar Corp's announcement on Thursday that it expected to fall short of analysts' fourth-quarter earnings estimates for what it believes are temporary factors includes one element -- a continued modest decline in commercial loans outstanding -- that could be a more lasting concern, analysts said. The Milwaukee-based bank holding company, which has $19.9 billion in assets, said it expects fourth quarter earnings of about $0.95 a share excluding any one-time gains, $0.08 short of the consensus and unchanged from a year ago.   Firstar is in the midst of a program to trim costs and enhance revenues and said factors including the implementation of that program and assimilation of recent acquisitions would hurt earnings. But the bank also said continued declines in its commercial loans outstanding would also hinder earnings, and was a temporary factor. ""I think while that sounds plausible, it also remains to be proven,"" said Ben Crabtree, banking analyst at Dain Bosworth. Crabtree had forecast earnings of $1.08 a share for the quarter.   While expenses from the restructuring and acquisitions should eventually be eliminated, analysts were not as sure that the loss of loans would be reversed. ""The question going forward, and that's an unanswerable question, is the long-term impact on the revenue side,"" said Thomas Maier, banking analyst at EVEREN Securities. Firstar investor relations spokesman Joe Messinger said the decline in loans outstanding is due mostly to the focus on the restructuring during the first two quarters of the year.   Firstar also said credit card charge-offs will remain higher than the company's historic levels in the quarter, though they will be in line with the industry overall. ""It's something they've indicated in the past,"" Maier said, adding that higher charge-offs were already built into his previous $1.05 a share estimate on fourth quarter earnings and outperform rating on the stock. In the 10-Q filing with the SEC for the third quarter, Firstar said it expected credit card charge-offs to rise to 4.5-5.0 percent in the fourth and first quarters, before declining to 4-4.5 percent. Charge-offs were 4.06 percent in the third quarter. If Firstar meets its $0.95 a share estimate for the quarter, 1996 earnings would be $3.34 a share, compared to $3.00 a share a year ago. Firstar shares fell one to 51 Thursday amid a downturn in banking stocks. ((--Chicago newsdesk 312 408 8787)) ",BradDorfman
"Mercantile Bancorp Inc's planned $1.07 billion purchase price for Roosevelt Financial Group Inc and an expected merger-related charge of $25-$30 million after tax both appear reasonable for an in-market deal, analysts said Monday. The St. Louis-based bank holding company said it expects to take the charge in the quarter the deal closes. ""For a deal this size, I think, it's probably relatively modest,"" analyst Steve Schroll at Piper Jaffray said.   Roosevelt, a $9 billion thrift holding company also located in St. Louis, has 83 branches, 73 of which overlap with Mercantile, Schroll said. The banks told analysts they expect to eliminate 50 of the overlapping branches by the middle of 1998, he said, adding that Mercantile also expects to cut 37 percent of Roosevelt's pre-tax cost base by 1999. In a news conference, Mercantile would not specifically say how many branches would be shut.   The cost reductions help justify the $1.07 billion price tag, which is about 11 times 1997 earnings estimates for Roosevelt, Schroll said. ""It's reasonable,"" Schroll said. ""For an in-market deal, because of the opportunities to save costs, it's reasonable."" With its recently announced plan to acquire Mark Twain Bancshares Inc for $855 million, Mercantile will be the largest financial institution in Missouri, with $30 billion in assets once both deals close. That could make Mercantile, often mentioned as a takeover candidate, even more attractive.   ""I'd say Merc was already attractive anyway,"" said Joseph Stieven, a banking analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, which advised Roosevelt on the deal. ""This makes them no less attractive."" Joseph Roberto, a banking analyst at Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods, said, ""I think it makes Mercantile more attractive. It gives them the number one market share across the state."" But the process of closing the two deals, expected in the second quarter, and absorbing the acquisitions could take Mercantile out of play as an acquisition target in the short term, analysts said. ""I would think in the short term, an acquisition of this size, when combined with the acquisition of Mark Twain, probably delays the likelihood of somebody from outside coming in to buy Mercantile,"" Schroll said. Meanwhile, St. Louis-based Magna Group Inc and Kansas City, Missouri-based Commerce Bancshares Inc could become more attractive for suitors looking to buy in the Missouri market, analysts said.

"Mercantile Bancorp Inc. said Monday it agreed to acquire Roosevelt Financial Group Inc. for about $1 billion in cash and stock, a move that would create the largest bank in Missouri. The companies said the acquisition will create the largest locally managed and independently owned financial services organisation based in the southern Midwest. It will make Mercantile the largest banking company in Missouri, with more than 23 percent of the state's deposits, Mercantile said. Mercantile will become the largest bank in St. Louis, where it is headquartered, and in Springfield, Mo., and will strengthen its presence in other major Missouri markets such as Kansas City. Roosevelt, a savings and loan with $9 billion in assets that is also based in St. Louis, has 81 offices and branches in Missouri, Kansas and Illinois. The acquisition follows Mercantile's agreement to buy Mark Twain Bancshares Inc., another St. Louis-based bank, for $855 million in stock. That deal was announced on Oct. 28. ""Our combination with Roosevelt will materially enhance our mix of strong retail, middle market lending and other speciality businesses,"" Mercantile Chairman Thomas Jacobsen said in a statement. Mercantile plans to take a pretax charge of $25 million to $30 million for merger-related costs when the deal closes next year but also expects it to add to earnings in 1997 and 1998, officials said. The deal would save about $20 million a year in branch costs annually, Jacobsen said but would not elaborate on how many branches would be closed. ""There will be some certainly, but probably fewer than you might think,"" Jacobsen said at a news conference. Analysts said they were told separately that about 50 overlapping branches were expected to be closed by 1998. Due to attrition and since the two companies will not be completely merged, layoffs were expected to be minimal, officials said. ""We're not aware of anyone at this time that won't be able to find a role with the ongoing company,"" said Stanley Bradshaw, chief executive at Roosevelt. Mercantile, which said both the Roosevelt and Mark Twain acquisitions were expected to close in the second quarter of 1997, would not rule out future acquisitions. ""We have continuing interest in Illinois, Iowa and Arkansas,"" said John Beirise, group vice president for emerging markets at Mercantile. ""Oklahoma has interest to us and would also be a logical extension."" The Mercantile that emerges after the pending takeovers are completed will have $30 billion in assets and could itself become an attractive takeover target, analysts said. Mercantile, which will have a stock market worth of more than $4 billion, could be even more attractive once the acquisitions have been assimilated. ""I'd say Merc was already attractive anyway,"" said Joseph Stieven, a banking analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, which advised Roosevelt on the deal. ""This makes them no less atttractive."" Said Joseph Roberto, banking analyst at Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods, ""I think it makes Mercantile more attractive. It gives them the No. 1 market share across the state."" Mercantile said it will exchange up to 13 million shares of its stock at a ratio of 0.4211 Mercantile share for each Roosevelt share, and pay $22 cash for each remaining share. Based on the $50.75 closing price Friday of Mercantile's shares on the New York Stock Exchange, the exchange ratio would value Roosevelt shares at about $21.37 each. Roosevelt's stock closed Friday at $18.125 on Nasdaq. Roosevelt shares added $2.375 to $20.50 on Nasdaq while Mercantile stock fell $1 to $49.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. Mercantile also said it planned to repurchase up to 7 million of its own shares in connection with the acquisition. ",BradDorfman
"'Twas the day before Christmas and all through the malls, retailers were looking for a last minute push for a merry holiday sales season. Industry analysts said sales were hovering near or a shade below expectations for the holiday shopping season so far. After a strong start, sales came in below retailers' own expectations last week, according to a weekly survey of chain store sales by BTM/Schroders, a venture of two investment houses. Analyst Michael Niemira at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, which compiles the index with Schroder/Wertheim, said he expected December sales to rise 4 percent to 4.5 percent, compared with earlier expectations for a 4.5 percent to 5.0 percent rise. But activity picked up Monday and Tuesday as shoppers, pinched by five fewer shopping days between Christmas and Thanksgiving this year or just old-fashioned procrastination, rushed to find gifts at the last minute, retailers said. ""It definitely feels active,"" said Karen Farnham, assistant manager at an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. in Manhattan. ""Yesterday (Monday, I'd say, was probably the busiest,"" she said, noting that Abercrombie customers spend hundreds of dollars apiece, on average. At the Limited Inc., last-minute shopping has been hectic, store manager Christina Vigo said in Manhattan. ""It's out of control. Yesterday was the busiest day all season. We started sales extremely early to draw business, but everyone's shopping last minute,"" she said, noting the average sale has been about $50. In New York, lone men, coursing through stores with a clear purpose, accounted for a good portion of store traffic on Christmas Eve. ""I'm just not finished yet. I get lazy, I guess,"" said Eric Gotthard. Tom Kurpiewski said he, too, fell behind in his holiday shopping, adding that he's spending about the same as he did in 1995. Saul Yaari, senior retailing analyst at Piper Jaffray Inc., said sales should be about 5 percent above last year's results, measuring on a store-for-store basis. Yaari said sales at department stores have slowed in the last week after a strong holiday start while discounters have done well. But people were still spending freely last weekend, reflecting a trend toward later shopping during the season, Yaari said. Clothing, shoes, jewelry and certain toys, such as Nintendo's new video game system and Tyco Toys Inc.'s Tickle Me Elmo, sold very well, Yaari said. ""Consumer electronics was a very poor category,"" he added, noting retailers were offering free computer accessories and generous financing terms to stir up interest. Analysts said the holiday shopping season and fourth quarter as a whole should be strong for retailers, boosted by tighter inventories and fewer unplanned promotions, as well as comparisons with a dismal season last year. Clothing continues to lead the stronger sales. ""My read so far is I don't think it was as promotional as last year in apparel,"" said Harry Ikenson, retailing analyst at Rodman &amp; Renshaw Inc.. He added that electronics sales appeared to be under much more pressure than apparel. Peter Schaeffer at Dillon Read &amp; Co. Inc., said he expected sales to rise 4 percent to 5 percent overall but only 2 percent to 3 percent at comparable stores open at least a year. Discounters and off-price retailers such as TJX Cos. Inc. and Ross Stores Inc., as well as some of the big chains, notably J.C. Penney Co. Inc. and Sears, Roebuck and Co., should do better than average, he said. ",BradDorfman
"Retailers looking for a post-Christmas rush to boost lukewarm holiday sales may be disappointed as snow in some areas and holiday exhaustion kept many shoppers from bargain-hunting Thursday. ""I think people did their shopping"" before Christmas, said John Konarski, vice president at the International Council of Shopping Centers, a group of retail mall operators that surveys 85 large regional malls across the country. ""You're going to have some people out today (but) you're not going to see the massive crowds some people expected."" Konarski said he expected that holiday season sales would be up 4 percent to 6 percent from a year ago, which is about what he expected before the season began. But after strong activity in the weekend following Thanksgiving, retailers' hopes for even better sales ended up being dashed by a slowdown in the week before Christmas. ""I think generally, the overall picture appears to be we had a good, solid holiday sales period, but not a spectacular one,"" said Tracy Mullin, president of the National Retail Federation, which represents major store chains. She said she expects holiday sales rose about 5 percent from last year, when gains were a weak 2.5 percent to 3 percent. Store officials and analysts said that while sales were coming in at or just below retailers' expectations, that still beats the dismal results last year. ""They slowed up very moderately, actually, from the input we're getting,"" said Jay Meltzer, managing director of LJR Redbook Research. ""You know, we didn't go over a cliff and a year ago we did go over a cliff."" In Chicago, snow and cold weather appeared to be keeping crowds down in the Michigan Avenue shopping district the day after Christmas. ""Sales today are relatively slow compared to before Christmas,"" said Julie Towson, manager of the Knot Crazy tie store in Water Tower Place. ""I think a lot of people spent all of their money before the holiday. Also, who wants to come out in this kind of weather?"" In central New York State, where it was also snowing, Konarski said there were lines at malls before stores opened at 7 a.m. EST (1200 GMT), but most shoppers were looking for markdowns on holiday accessories and to return merchandise. In Cleveland, many workers were on vacation and some offices were closed, and shopper traffic at the Tower City Center mall complex was moderate. ""We've had a good, strong season,"" said the manager of a women's clothing store who has worked in retailing 11 years. ""Business today is pretty good. Volume is moderate."" At Tower City's AnnTaylor store, sales associate Mary Rogonjich said Thursday morning traffic was slow but she expected things to pick up during lunch hour. ""Things have been steady this morning, and we have not had that many returns,"" she said. ""We've had a very good season -- above plan."" The store was offering up to 50 percent off on silk blouses, pants, jackets, shoes and other items on Thursday. In Miami, some shops were seeing more traffic. ""The store is very busy. Really everything is marked down,"" said a spokeswoman at Federated Department Stores Inc.'s Macy's store in Miami's Falls mall. But analysts said that while promotions picked up before Christmas and would accelerate this week, special discounts were fewer and less steep than last year, which should help retailer profits. ""Some retailers did get promotional in the last few days,"" Mullin said. ""I think you'll see it really starting today."" Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, said in a telephone message for investors on Monday that discount and warehouse sales were at the low end of plan for the holidays in the third week of December. The company is in line for sales increases of 4 percent to 5 percent for November and December, the company said. Dayton Hudson Corp. said on Tuesday sales were meeting expectations and that the company had planned its inventories well. Sears, Roebuck and Co. said overall sales and sales at stores open at least a year were showing upper-single digit increases. ""Overall sales were strong the last three days before Christmas,"" Vice President of Marketing John Costello said, noting that clothing, tools, jewelry, multimedia computers and tires sold well.

"Magna Group Inc. has a definitive agreement to acquire Homeland Bankshares Corp., the second-largest banking company in Iowa, for about $216 million, the companies said Tuesday. St. Louis-based Magna will issue 5 million shares of its common stock and pay $92 million in cash in exchange for all theoutstanding Homeland common shares. Homeland shareholders may choose to exchange each of their shares for either about 1.55 Magna shares, a comparable amount in cash or a combination. Magna said it will repurchase about 600,000 shares of the stock, under its current repurchase plan. ""We certainly will consider buy back programmes beyond that, but nothing has been approved beyond that,"" G. Thomas Andes, Magna chairman, said in a news conference. Waterloo, Iowa-based Homeland, with assets of $1.2 billion as of June 30, owns and operates four commercial banks and one savings bank and provides financial services through a network of 33 locations in Iowa. Magna, with $5.35 billion in assets, is the third-largest banking institution in the St. Louis metropolitan area and the nation's 95th largest banking company. It has 106 banking locations throughout Illinois and Missouri and a trust and brokerage company. After the acquisition, Magna would have about 55 percent of its assets in Illinois, 25 percent in Missouri and 20 percent in Iowa, Andes said. The deal is subject to approval by Homeland shareholders and regulators. Magna said it expected the acquisition to boost earnings within 12 months, and save about $8 million through centralization of systems and procedures. Some of the cost savings will come from job cuts, though those cuts could come from attrition, Andes said. Homeland Chief Executive Erl Schmiesing said during the news conference that cuts were underway at Homeland in any case as it consolidated. Magna will continue to consider other acqusitions, possibly in Iowa, Andes said. ""We certainly like the state of Iowa,"" he said. ""We would certainly welcome the opportunity to expand in the state of Iowa, as well as Illinois and Missouri."" Magna is also among several Missouri-based banks considered by analysts to be likely acquisition targets, a perception that did not change with the Homeland acquisition announcment. ""It certainly doesn't make them any less attractive or likely as a takeover candidate,"" said Steven Schroll, a banking industry analyst at Piper Jaffray. Homeland's stock rose $1.75 to $35.75, while Magna edged down 6.25 cents to $24.81 Tuesday on Nasdaq. ",BradDorfman
"Rawlings Sporting Goods Inc chief financial officer Paul Martin said on Friday the company is not for sale, although it recognizes its responsibility to shareholders. ""The company is not for sale and the company doesn't comment on takeover rumors,"" Martin said in a telephone interview. ""Obviously, we recognize our fiduciary responsibilities."" Stock of the St. Louis-based sporting goods company has jumped more than 50 percent since early December, with market sources pointing to takeover rumors.   ""We keep hearing takeover, takeover,"" said one analyst, who does not follow the stock directly. Another analyst said he was skeptical there were any takeover talks currently underway. ""I think it's just pure speculation right now, I don't think there's anything happening,"" said Timothy Conder, analyst at A.G. Edwards. He added that, based on fundamentals, the stock, which closed up 1-1/8 at 12-5/8 Friday, has a fair price of 9-1/2.   In a research report on Thursday, Conder reiterated a maintain/aggressive rating on the stock, saying in the long term, Rawlings brand name makes it an attractive takeover candidate. One potential acquirer for Rawlings that is repeatedly mentioned is Beaverton, Oregon-based Nike Inc. A Nike spokesperson could not be reached for comment Friday. Conder said Friday the case for Nike is that it would round out the company's on-field baseball presence. But the case against Nike is that Rawlings is too small and does not have margins that match Nike's.   Martin said Rawlings is scheduled to report fiscal 1997 first quarter financial results Tuesday, but added the company in November said it expected to report a modest loss for the quarter. Rawlings said it expected revenues to decline in the quarter because of lower sales in baseballs and baseball gloves. The company reported net income of $890,000, or $0.12 a share a year ago. Conder pointed out in his research note that the recent settlement of the Major League Baseball labor situation removes a large risk factor. Major League Baseball is also considering using commemorative Jackie Robinson and Joe DiMaggio baseballs during the 1997 baseball season, which could boost Rawlings business in 1997, he said.

"Magna Group Inc's planned acquisition of Homeland Bankshares Corp is not likely to alter the St. Louis-based bank holding company's own potential to be acquired, analysts said. ""It certainly doesn't make them any less attractive or likely as a takeover candidate,"" said Steven Schroll, a banking industry analyst at Piper Jaffray. Magna is among several Missouri-based banks considered by analysts to be likely acquisition targets.   ""I don't think it probably changes the company either way too much"" in terms of takeover prospects, said Joseph Stieven, a banking analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. Still, with Iowa's limit on how much of the state's total deposits a single banking company can hold, Magna's acquisition of Iowa-based Homeland could prevent some potential buyers from swallowing up Magna, analysts noted. ""It could complicate it, because Iowa does have relatively low state cap,"" Stieven said. ""But it doesn't necessarily mean it was done as a defensive measure.""   Schroll's initial reading of the proposed deal is that it will add to Magna's earnings in 1997, the year the deal is expected to close. ""We believe it could be 15 cents accretive, maybe more,"" Schroll said, cautioning that this was a preliminary view of the deal. Magna said in a news release the deal would be accretive within 12 months. Other analysts noted that Homeland has a relatively high ratio of equity to assets and said paying about 1.65 times book value for Homeland might be a bit expensive. Homeland's ratio of equity to assets was 10.79 percent in the second quarter. The price of ""165 (percent) of book could be pretty generous if you've got an overcapitalized bank,"" said Ben Crabtree, banking analyst at Dain Bosworth. ""It sounds like a pretty big price,"" agreed Stieven. Magna was down 1/4 at 24-1/2 Monday afternoon, while Homeland was up 2-1/4 at 36-1/4. --Reuters Chicago newsdesk, 312-408-8787 ",BradDorfman
"Aiming to fill Americans' seemingly insatiable desire for sport utility vehicles, Chrysler Corp.  and Ford Motor Co.  both introduced new models of the go-anywhere vehicles Tuesday at the North American International Auto Show. The plush Lincoln Navigator and the brawny Dodge Durango were introduced a day after General Motors Corp.'s unit unveiled an upscale version of its popular Yukon sport/utility vehicle and Subaru of America Inc., a unit of Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd  7270T, debuted a new sport/utility based on a passenger car chassis. Sport/utility vehicles sales climbed to just over two million in the United States in 1996 and are the fastest-growing automotive segment. The vehicles are so popular that even sportscar maker Porsche AG said Tuesday it also plans to enter the market by the turn of the century. Although more and more companies are adding more and more models, the market is yet to be saturated, as more drivers foresake cars for the larger vehicles. ""They really are considered substitutes,"" said Diane Swonk, deputy chief economist at First Chicago NBD Corp. ""These are replacing old station wagons. They're also eating very heavily into the luxury car markets."" Luxury is a key feature of the new Ford and GM models. Ford's Lincoln Navigator, which is expected to be available in July, includes leather seating surfaces, walnut wood accents and second row bucket seats. It is expected to be priced in the mid-$40,000 range and will compete at the premium end of the market with vehicles by Lexus and Land Rover. It is aimed at affluent empty nesters or high-profile active families. The target age for Navigator owners is 45-55, said Jim O'Connor, general manager of Ford's Lincoln Mercury division. The vehicle, which O'Connor expects will sell 20,000 annually, was driven through a mock rock wall and waterfall to make its debut. The vehicle seats eight, has a 5.4-litre V8 engine with 8,000 pound towing capacity and 116.4 cubic feet of cargo space. GMC's Yukon Denali, which is scheduled to be in production in  the 1998 calendar year, features four heated seats and a premium sound system, among other accessories. ""We're certainly going upscale,"" Roy Roberts, general manager of GM's Pontiac-GMC division, said when asked about pricing. He declined to comment further. Chrysler made its typical auto show splash with the introduction of the Dodge Durango, which broke through the floor of a mock-up of the automaker's new headquarters building. Touting it as a breakthrough vehicle that offers ""more of everything,"" Chrysler said sales could eventually reach 200,000 units. The automaker invested $910 million to bring the vehicle to market. The Durango, which goes on sale in December, uses the same chassis and beefy front end as the Dodge Dakota pickup truck. It is aimed at a more downscale audience than Chrysler's tony Jeep Grand Cherokee. One unique feature is a rear cargo well sized to fit a hunting rifle. The vehicle is bigger than Ford's popular Explorer, but smaller than the Yukon, Navigator and Ford Expedition. Durango features an optional third bench seat, boosting its seating capacity up to eight people. Despite growing criticism about sport/utilities' poor fuel economy, the Durango offers the biggest engines in its class, including 5.2-litre and 5.9-litre V8s. Pricing was not announced, but Chrysler Vice Chairman Robert Lutz said the Durango could be made with a four-cylinder engine, if necessary. With so many new sport/utility vehicles entering the market, it is becoming more competitive, which will eventually lead to pressure on margins. ""We'll get saturation if people can't afford to buy these things, relative to the cars they drive,"" said Joseph Phillippi, analyst at Lehman Brothers. Demand for more affordable sport/utilities will push manufacturers to build them on car platforms, as Subaru, Toyota and Honda are doing, Phillippi said, adding that few drivers travel far off road and don't need the ruggedness and high ground clearance of a truck-based sport/utility. Executives at the Big Three automakers stress that their new sport/utility vehicles will not compete with existing lines. ""We don't think this will be a major drag at all on Expedition,"" O'Connor said of Ford's current top-of-the-line sport utility vehicle. Instead, he said the Navigator should attract new customers to Lincoln-Mercury. ""I think it will bring a whole new customer to Lincoln,"" he said. But the automakers also know that if they don't offer sport/utility vehicles in a variety of niches, others will. ""I'd rather have the alternative be in my dealer"" showroom, said Chrysler's Lutz. As for Porsche, Chairman Wendelin Wiedeking would not go into specifics on the German automaker's plans in the sector, other than to say it was in discussions with a third party. ",BradDorfman
"The U.S. economy should provide a repeat in 1997 of the steady growth seen in 1996, which should also lead to car and truck sales near 1996 levels, according to economists who work for the Big Three automakers. Economists for Ford Motor Co and General Motors Corp both forecast vehicle sales between 15 million and 15.5 million in 1997, while Chrysler Corp's economist predicted sales of 15.2 million. Sales were about 15.4 million in 1996. The forecasts were made in a presentation to the Society of Automotive Analysts.   ""We are likely to see more of the same,"" Chrysler's W. Van Bussmann said, echoing the view of the other two analysts. ""We see no significant changes in either direction on fiscal or monetary policy,"" said G. Mustafa Mohatarem of General Motors. Ford's Martin Zimmerman was even more optimistic. ""I frankly don't see why this growth can't continue into 1998,"" he said.   But that does not mean the auto industry has no concerns. The one short-term worry all three economists voiced was the weakening of the yen, which fell to about 117 to the dollar Monday from about 106 a year ago. A weaker yen makes Japanese imports, including automobiles, less expensive in the United States. That, in turn, makes Japanese cars more competitive in the U.S. market, giving Japanese automakers more flexibility in pricing, analysts said.   But the analysts all expected political or market pressures to cause the yen to stabilize and then strengthen somewhat against the dollar this year. ""We should see the yen start to strengthen,"" Zimmerman said. Bussmann forecast the yen at 106 to the dollar by the end of 1997. In western Europe, analysts see continued economic pressure associated with the move to European union in 1999 continuing to weigh on the economy there and keep vehicle sales about flat.   But Mohatarem argued that there is a possibility for a positive surprise in central Europe, saying Russia could achieve three percent economic growth by 1998. Mexico was also seen as an area for growth, with that economy recoverying quicker than expected from the recent peso crisis, analysts said. Meanwhile, Bussmann argued that capacity usage for truck production will remain at about 80 percent through the year 2000 and that truck demand as a percentage of total vehicle market share will continue to rise. ""We see the light truck demand reaching 50 percent (of total vehicle demand) by just past the turn of the century,"" he said. But other analysts were not as optimistic about demand for light trucks, which generally have higher profit margins than cars. ""I don't think it will reach 50 percent of demand,"" said Thomas Webb, chief economist with the National Automobile Dealers Association. During his presentation, Webb also said his forecast for 1997 auto sales was on the low end of a range he defined between 14.7 million and 15.1 million autos.

"Chrysler Corp. Wednesday introduced all-new versions of its Chrysler Concorde and Dodge Intrepid family sedans, part of a $2.1 billion revamp of the car line that helped rescue the automaker five years ago. Detroit's third-largest automaker said the cars, which will reach showrooms in the fall, will stay in the same price range as the cars they replace -- about $20,000-$26,000. The strategy contrasts with that of Ford Motor Co., which in 1995 introduced a redesigned Taurus sedan with more upscale features that resulted in higher prices. Ford later brought out a lower-priced Taurus when sales failed to meet expectations. ""Our concept is to keep them as affordable as possible and keep them in the same price range of today's"" models, Chrysler Vice Chairman Robert Lutz told reporters following the introduction of the new model at the North American International Auto Show here. Chrysler introduced the original ""LH"" car line in 1992 at a time when the automaker was emerging from its second brush with bankruptcy in a decade. Dubbed by some analysts as the company's ""Last Hope,"" the cars' acceptance by consumers brought badly needed cash and confidence to the company. Chrysler did not introduce other LH variants, which include replacements for the Chrysler LHS luxury car and the Eagle Vision. Improved production processes will help keep prices down, though the cars' features include all new engine technology, Lutz said. The cars, as well as two other models to be introduced in the fall, were the result of a 31-month development programme that cost Chrysler about $2.1 billion, including two new overhead-cam V-6 engines, Chrysler said. The automaker expects to sell 250,000 to 260,000 of the cars annually, with the Intrepid accounting for about 50 percent of the sales and the other three models making up the rest. To follow up on its launch Tuesday of the new Durango sport/utility vehicle, which broke through the floor of a mock-up of Chrysler's new corporate headquarters, Chrysler unveiled the new sedans in a fake thunderstorm, complete with water falling on the Cobo Hall stage. The theme of the presentation was ""Lightning Strikes Twice."" The programme marks the launch of a new family of V-6 engines for Chrysler, part of a significant revamping of the company's engine line. The base models of both cars will be powered by an all- aluminum, 2.7-litre 24-valve V-6 engine rated at 200 horsepower. The Concorde LXi and Intrepid ES will have 3.2-litre, 24-valve V-6 engines rated at 220 horsepower. Chrysler said it engineered the cars to offer a quieter ride and better handling than current models. The cars also include larger headlights and larger brakes, increased usable cargo room, platinum tipped spark plugs and a ""coil-on-plug"" ignition system to eliminate tuneups before 100,000 miles, Chrysler said. Chrysler stressed that the two sedans are designed to appeal to different consumers, with Intrepid geared toward slightly younger, less affluent buyers. The cars will be assembled at Chrysler's Bramalea, Ontario plant. Lutz admitted that Chrysler was introducing the cars into a declining market for sedans, with typical sedan buyers now opting for other choices, including sport/utility vehicles. But he said the decline was cyclical and could change with the next generation of car buyers. ""We know each generation rejects what its parents had,"" said Lutz. ",BradDorfman
"U.S. retailers reported overall sales near plan for the key December holiday shopping month Thursday, but results varied widely by store and sector with department stores appearing to take some market share from specialty stores. ""The major retailers continue to gain market share,"" said Michael Niemira, analyst with Bank of Tokyo/Mitsubishi Ltd. ""Even within the Sears report, they talk about the electronics area being one of the stronger areas"" while that area was weak for retailers overall.""

"First Chicago NBD Corp said Wednesday rising bankruptcy filings contributed to a rise in credit card charge offs in the fourth quarter. Charge offs rose to 6.7 percent of managed receivables in the quarter, compared to 5.9 percent a year ago. ""The fourth quarter increase is due to a combination of factors, including a resurgence of bankruptcy filings after a third quarter lull, an increase in contractual charge offs, and average loan volume that was basically flat in the third quarter,"" chief financial officer Robert Rosholt said.   But in a telephone message to investors, Rosholt also noted that credit card fee revenue rose 28 percent from a year ago to $259 million, adjusting for securitization. ""Clearly this demonstrates bank card's ability to counter some of the effects of deteriorating credit quality,"" he said. While the credit card business continues to be profitable for the $104.6 billion asset bank holding company, some analysts noted the charge-off rate was high. ""I think that's very clear that that's not as profitable an operation as it is at other places,"" said James Schutz, analyst at Chicago Corp.   But other analysts said the bank has tightened credit standards in the past year and were less concerned about the charge-off rate. ""That thing has bounced around all over this year (1996) and it's still a very profitable line of business this year,"" said Robert Ollech, analyst at Principal Financial Securities. Rosholt also said the bank plans to improve its trading operations to restore results in market-driven revenues.   Market-driven revenues were $83 million in the fourth quarter, up from $40 million in the previous quarter but down from the bank's average of $100 million a quarter, Rosholt said. Trading profits were $12 million in the quarter, compared to a $12 million loss in the third quarter. ""We plan to get back to our $100 million per quarter average as we improve our execution of trading activities this year,"" Rosholt said. Return on common equity was 17.5 percent in the quarter, up from 15.4 percent a year ago, while return on assets was 1.46 percent, up from 1.02 percent a year ago.

"Equity Residential Properties Trust, a real estate investment trust led by Chicago real estate investor Sam Zell, agreed Friday to buy Wellsford Residential Property Trust( in a deal valuing Wellsford at $1 billion. The deal would make Equity Residential, which is already the largest publicly traded apartment building owner in the country, the second largest real estate investment trust in any category, the company said. ""Consolidation of this industry is critical for its evolution,"" Zell, who is chairman of Equity Residential, said in a statement. ""The size and liquidity of the combined entity reinforces EQR's status as the No. 1 multifamily (real estate investment trust)."" The deal values New York-based Wellsford at about $1 billion, or $29.61 a share, an 18.7 percent premium over its recent stock price, the companies said. Equity Residential said it expected to trim about $3.1 million in annual general and administrative expenses and $800,000 in property management expenses after the closing of the deal, which is expected to occur by May. Equity Residential expects the merger to add 10 cents to 13 cents a share in annualized funds from operation -- the measure commonly used to measure real estate investment fund performance. When the deal closes, Equity Residential will own and operate 317 properties with 90,873 units. It also adds properties in areas like the Pacific Northwest and West Coast, where strong demand allows for higher rents. ""Those markets have higher rental growth than the national average from other markets,"" said Jeff Langbaum, associate analyst at investment firm Alex. Brown &amp; Sons. Equity Residential estimated rent growth in those areas at 5 percent to 6 percent annualy, while Langbaum estimated the national average at about 4 percent. Each Wellsford share will be exchanged for 0.625 share of Equity Residential, or about $27.11, plus one share of Wellsford Properties Inc., a newly formed company that will continue Wellsford's development activities, the companies said in a joint statement. The exchange ratio is subject to upward revision if Equity Residential shares fall below $40. If they drop below $37, the parties have the right to terminate the merger agreement. Equity Residential also will exchange about $158 million in preferred shares. In addition, Equity Residential will assume about $330 million in Wellsford's debt. The deal continues the consolidation of real estate investment trusts (REIT). ""It's pretty apparent that that's the way the REIT world, especially apartments right now, is heading,"" Langbaum said. In December, Houston-based Cambden Property Trust said it would acquire Dallas-based Paragon Group Inc., to create an apartment real estate trust with 36,199 units. Unlike the hostile takeover Zell's Manufactured Home Communites Inc. launched against Chateau Properties Inc., which was rebuffed by the manufactured housing community operator last year, the Equity Residential deal was unanimously approved by both companies' boards of trustees, the companies said. Wellsford shares were up $1.875 at $27.625, while Equity Residential was down $1.125 at $42.25 on the New York Stock Exchange in late trading. ",BradDorfman
"Caterpillar Inc. Tuesday reported record profits of $1.36 billion for 1996, spurred by a 27 percent jump in fourth-quarter earnings, but said it expected near flat results this year. The world's largest heavy equipment maker said earnings for all of 1996 rose from 1995's $1.14 billion while revenues grew 2.8 percent to $16.52 billion from $16.07 billion. For the fourth quarter, profits rose to $381 million, or $1.99 a share, from $300 million, or $1.53 a share, in the 1995 period. Peoria, Ill.-based Caterpillar's fourth-quarter results exceeded Wall Street analysts' average estimate of $1.88 a share, according to First Call Corp., which tracks earnings estimates. Despite the strong results, investors pushed Caterpillar's stock down $2.125 to $76.375 on the New York Stock Exchange, apparently on concerns about the outlook for 1997. The company said it expected 1997 profits to be nearly flat with 1996 levels, with revenues from ongoing operations growing only slightly. Caterpillar said higher demand in developing regions should offset a slightly weaker market for its machines in the United States and Japan this year. ""It's basically '97,"" Lisa Shalett, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said of the stock's fall. But she added that one-time currency factors also helped boost the earnings above estimates. ""It comes across as a surprise, but it's not necessarily a surprise from operations,"" Shalett said of fourth-quarter earnings. But other analysts suggested Cateprillar was being too conservative in its view for 1997. ""Caterpillar always looks at the glass being half empty,"" said Thomas Burns Jr., analyst at NatWest Securities Corp. ""We think its half full. ""We expect a better U.S. economy,"" he said. ""We don't expect housing starts to be off."" He noted that Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan made positive comments about the economy on Tuesday. Caterpillar said it stood by its forecast, but was prepared to meet higher demand than expected, as it did in 1996. ""We're trying to call it as we see it,"" Chief Financial Officer Douglas Oberhelman said in a telephone interview. ""I will tell you that a year ago, we called for a softer economy in the U.S. and it didn't happen. We were pleasantly surprised."" Caterpillar said profit margins as a percent of sales rose to 25.2 percent in 1996 from 22.3 percent in 1995 due to higher prices and the effect of the stronger dollar against the yen and European currencies. Lower material costs and improvements in the manufacturing process also helped. Total capital expenditures in 1996 were $642 million and are expected to increase 10 to 15 percent in 1997, Caterpillar said. ""In 1997, we plan to increase spending for capital assets, research and product development to enhance our prospects for long-term growth and profitability,"" Chairman Donald Fites said in a statement accompanying the results. ""In addition, we intend to increase our investments for new business opportunities around the globe."" Research and development spending is expected to rise 20 percent from $410 million in 1996, the company said. Major initiatives include electric power generation, agricultural products, mining systems, compact machines and strengthening the company's product support system, Caterpillar said. ",BradDorfman
"Caterpillar Inc chief financial officer Douglas Oberhelman said Tuesday that an increase in U.S. dealer new machine inventories at the end of 1996 was intentional. ""It's higher than it was a year ago and that's by design,"" Olberhelman said in an interview with Reuters. ""As it turned out last year, we didn't have enough inventory in dealer hands and this year we will, we hope,"" he said. Some analysts expressed concern Tuesday at the increase in inventories.   The Peoria, Illinois-based heavy equipment maker Tuesday reported record net income of $381 million or $1.99 a share for the fourth quarter, up from $300 million or $1.53 a share a year ago and $0.11 ahead of consensus estimates. But the company's outlook that the 1997 profit level would ""approximate"" that of 1996 appeared to be pushing the stock lower Tuesday. Oberhelman defended the company's view of slowing U.S. economic growth in the face of analysts' comments that the view was too conservative.   ""We're trying to call it as we see it,"" he said. ""I will tell you that a year ago, we called for a softer economy in the U.S. and it didn't happen. We were pleasantly surprised."" He added that the company is prepared to increase production if demand is stronger than expected, as it did in 1996. After focusing the last several years on improving operations, Oberhelman said the company now thinks it's time to increase spending on research and development and on capital assets to improve shareholder value in the future.   Total capital expenditures were $642 million in 1996 and are expected to rise 10 to 15 percent in 1997, while research and development is expected to rise 20 percent from the $410 million spent in 1996, Caterpillar said. ""It's going to be a little bit of everything,"" he said when asked if the expenditures would be focused on acquisition or internal development. He said the company is likely to continue its pace of about 50 new or upgraded product introductions a year through 1999. One area the company is looking to gain in is power generation equipment, a $5 billion worldwide market Caterpillar sees tripling in the next several years. ""We'll still be building there, both internally and through acquisitions,"" he said. Caterpillar shares were down 1-3/4 at 76-3/4 Tuesday. (Chicago newsdesk 312 408 8787) ",BradDorfman
"A conservative forecast for 1997, calling for profits near 1996 levels, helped push Caterpillar Inc stock lower despite record earnings reported for 1996 Tuesday. But the outlook was also causing some analysts to question the conservatism of the Peoria-based heavy equipment maker. ""Caterpillar always looks at the glass being half empty,"" said Thomas Burns Jr., an analyst at NatWest Securities Corp. ""We think it's half full.""   ""We expect a better U.S. economy,"" Burns said. ""We don't expect housing starts to be off."" He noted that Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan made positive comments about the economy Tuesday. But Caterpillar said in its earnings statement that it expects U.S. gross domestic product growth of about two percent in 1997, slower than in 1996. Burns is also more optimistic about European growth than Caterpillar. ""Clearly, as far as we're concerned, there's a turn up on the way in Europe,"" he said.   But in Caterpillar's view, bullish factors will be offset by delays of infrastructure products as countries impose fiscal restraint to meet the entry criteria for the European Monetary Union. Caterpillar reported earnings of $381 million, or $1.99 a share for the fourth quarter of 1996, above the $1.53 a share reported in 1995 and the consensus estimate of $1.88 a share reported by First Call Corp.   But the stock was down 1-1/8 at 77-3/8 Tuesday, mostly because of the outlook. ""It's basically '97,"" Lisa Shalett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said of the stock's downturn. But she noted that one-time currency factors helped boost the earnings above estimates. ""It comes across as a surprise, but it's not necessarily a surprise from operations,"" Shalett said. Still, despite Caterpillar's guidance on profits in 1997, Burns and other analysts are sticking by estimates showing earnings per share climbing from the $7.07 reported in 1996. Burns estimates earnings of $7.70 a share for 1997. Blair Brumley, an analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc, is even more bullish, forecasting earnings of $8.00 a share. ""It doesn't look like there's anything in the outlook statement that would cause us to be concerned with this year,"" Brumley said, noting that share repurchases, gains in the engine business from a recent acquisition and price gains from new products should boost earnings. ""Even assuming flat unit sales, you're not going to see a flat bottom line,"" he said. ((Chicago newsdesk 312 408 8787)) ",BradDorfman
"Intuit Inc Wednesday launched its new, streamlined banking system on America Online Inc's online computer system, with some of the largest banks in the United States agreeing to use the product. Intuit's BankNOW will be offered as part of America Online's Banking Center, along with products by CheckFree Corp, Online Resources and  Visa Interactive.   BankNOW is geared to customers who wish to conduct banking transactions such as bill paying and fund transfers online, but do not use the personal finance software that is part of Intuit's Quicken banking package, Mountain View, California-based Intuit said in a news release. So far, 14 U.S. financial institutions, including First Chicago NBD Corp and CoreStates Financial Corp are using BankNOW, with an additional eight committed to use the product, Intuit said.   Dulles, Virginia-based America Online, said 19 financial institutions provide banking services on the system. The BankNOW software can be downloaded for free from America Online. Financial institutions charge their customers for using the product. For example, First Chicago said it will charge $3.95 a month for customers using online-banking and $9.95 a month for online banking and bill paying, though some premium checking account users will be able to do online banking for free. First Chicago looks at BankNOW as a premium service it can offer customers. ""We think there is a large market for this,"" First Chicago spokesman Thomas Kelly said. ""We also think this is a point of differention in our markets."" But to some, the scope of online banking still remains in doubt. ""I don't know whether its the wave of the future,"" said James Schutz, banking analyst at Chicago Corp. ""I don't think they (the banks) know either.

"Sears, Roebuck and Co. Thursday said earnings jumped 24.6 percent in the fourth quarter, boosted by strong sales and improved profit margins during the Christmas selling season. ""We ended the year with excellent fourth-quarter results, which are even more impressive given the strength of last year's fourth quarter,"" Sears Chairman Arthur Martinez said in a statement. December included the company's first ever back-to-back billion-dollar sales weeks, he said. The Christmas season is crucial for retailers since store chains typically earn half or more of their annual profit during the period. ""They had a great 1996 capped off by the best Christmas of any department store operator,"" said Alan Rifkin, analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc. He noted that Sears' sales at comparable stores rose 9.5 percent in December. The nation's second-largest retailer said earnings rose to $567 million, or $1.42 a share, in the quarter, from $455 million,  or $1.13 a share, in the 1995 period. Sales grew 10.8 percent to $12.04 billion from $10.87 billion. The earnings beat Wall Street forecasts that averaged $1.38 a share, according to First Call, which tracks estimates. But Sears' stock fell $2 to $49.125 on the New York Stock Exchange, mostly on profit-taking. ""The stock was up strongly early in the week and I think people are just taking profits,"" Rifkin said. Analysts said Sears gained from its decision to remodel some stores and expand its clothing offerings. ""Clearly they're gaining market share and clearly they're doing the right thing and the consumer likes what she sees when she goes into the store,"" said Karen Sack, analyst at the S&amp;P Equity Group. Operating income from domestic operations rose 14.8 percent to $531 million in the quarter as revenue rose 11.6 percent to $10.92 billion. Comparable-store sales rose 5.4 percent for the quarter. Operating income from domestic operations for all of 1996 rose 20.9 percent to $1.28 billion, while revenues increased 10.2 percent to $34.85 billion. Gross margins as a percent of merchandise sales rose to 27.9 percent from 26.9 percent in the 1995 period. Rifkin said margins were not likely to rise as much in 1997 as in the fourth quarter, but said cost-cutting should drive earnings growth this year. He forecast earnings at $3.60 a share in 1997 and $4.25 a share in 1998, up from $3.12 a share in 1996. International operations, including merchandising and credit operations in Canada and Mexico, earned $36 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of $7 million in the 1995 period. The increase in earnings was largely attributable to improved performance at both Sears Canada and Sears Mexico, lower selling and administrative expenses at Sears Mexico, and writeoffs of Sears Canada properties in the year-ago quarter, it said. Sears, based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., operates more than 800 department stores and 2,500 other stores offering clothing, home and automotive products and services. While earnings rose in the quarter, they fell for the year, in part because 1995 included a gain of $776 million from the former Allstate Corp. subsidiary, which was spun off to Sears' shareholders in June 1995. For all of 1996, Sears earned $1.27 billion, or $3.12 a share, in net profits, down from $1.80 billion, or $4.50 a share, in 1995. Sales grew 9 percent to $38.22 billion from $35.0 billion.

"Wallace Computer Services Inc. said Thursday its directors will unanimously recommend that shareholders reject a bid by Wyser-Pratte &amp; Co. Inc. to gain control of the computer services company's board. Wyser-Pratte, which holds 2.3 percent of Wallace's outstanding shares, has proposed three candidates as directors for the Lisle, Ill.-based company, as well as a special committee to explore ways to maximize shareholder value. It seeks to remove Wallace's poison pill takeover defence, which requires an 80 percent vote to approve certain mergers. Wyser-Pratte filed the proposals with the Securities and Exchange Commission after Moore Corp. Ltd., a huge Canadian business forms manufacturer, abandoned a 13-month campaign to acquire Wallace in a $1.3 billion deal in early August. Wallace's board said in a letter to Wyser-Pratte that it will recommend that its shareholders vote against the proposals at their annual meeting on Nov. 6, as they are not in the best interests of them or the company. Wallace said it was aware that Wyser-Pratte tried to contact the three Wallace directors who were nominated by former suitor Moore at last year's annual meeting. ""You should be under no illusion that you or your purported director nominees have three allies on the Wallace board. We want to emphasise that we are unanimous in opposing your actions,"" the letter said. Guy Wyser-Pratte, president of Wyser-Pratte, responded that he would continue to push his proposals. He said although Wallace had increased its dividend substantially and reported higher-than-expected earnings Wednesday, the stock was only up slightly. Wallace rose 12.5 cents to close at $27.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. ""They're not delivering value to shareholders,"" he said. Wallace said its profits jumped to $19.2 million, or 42 cents a share, in the fourth quarter ended July 31, from $15.8 million, or 35 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Sales rose 8.2 percent to $214.5 million from $198.2 million. Factoring in the company's stock split, the stock is trading at just over $54, compared with Moore's offer last year of $60, Wyser-Pratte said. ""It's been a year and nothing has happened with the stock,"" he said. However, analysts said that strong business fundamentals and a presumed change in Wallace's shareholder profile should protect it from Wyser-Pratte's proposals. Many arbitrageurs likely sold their Wallace stock after Moore abandoned its 13-month takeover campaign, resulting in more shareholders interested in long-term gains, analysts said. ",BradDorfman
"Mercury Finance Co. said Wednesday it found problems in its bookkeeping that caused it to overstate earnings by $90 million over four years and that its chief accountant had apparently disappeared. The Northbrook, Ill.-based finance company said the irregularities appear to have come from unauthorised entries in financial records by its chief accounting officer. The company said a special committee of the board has been formed to investigate with legal and accounting experts. The accountant, James Doyle, was last seen at the company on Jan. 23, the day it reported fourth quarter results, Mercury Finance spokesman Joseph Kopec said. ""He called Friday and said he would not be in for personal reasons,"" Kopec said. ""They haven't seen him since."" Doyle's whereabouts were unknown. The problems may jeopardise Mercury's planned acquisition of Fidelity Acceptance Corp., a consumer finance company, from BankBoston Corp. in a $393 million deal announced on Jan. 10. Wednesday's announcement caught the financial community by surprise, with analysts unwilling to comment after Mercury's statement, saying they were still trying to gather information. As a result of the adjustments, shareholders' equity as of Dec. 31, 1996, would be reduced from $353 million to $263 million, the company said. As a result of the overstatement of earnings, Mercury said it is in violation of some of its debt agreements and was negotiating with lenders. It said its financial condition remained strong and would support continuing operations and its expansion plans. BankBoston said it would await the results of the accounting investigation before proceeding with the sale of Fidelity Acceptance. Mercury said it was optimistic about completing the deal. Mercury said 1996 net income would be restated to $56.7 million from $120.7 million, 1995 profits would be cut to $76.9 million from $98.9 million and 1994 earnings would be $83 million instead of the $86.5 million originally reported. In addition, 1993 profits would be trimmed to $64.2 million from $64.9 million. Mercury stock was halted all day on the New York Stock Exchange. It closed Tuesday at $14.875. Moody's Investors Service cut its rating on Mercury's short-term borrowings and Standard &amp; Poor's said it may lower its rating. Mercury Finance suffered another blow last year, when Daniel Terra, chairman of the company since it went public in 1989, died in June. ",BradDorfman
"Mercury Finance Co.'s agreement to buy a consumer finance business fell apart Thursday after the auto-loan company said phony bookkeeping entries had inflated its earnings and it had fired its chief accountant. At the same time, the officer blamed for the overstated earnings may be cooperating with federal authorities. BankBoston Corp. said it terminated its agreement to sell its Fidelity Acceptance Corp. unit to Mercury for 32.7 million shares of Mercury stock. When the deal was announced on Jan. 10, the stock was worth about $458 million. Mercury Finance stock has not traded since it closed at $14.875 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. The NYSE would not indicate where the stock might open but traders said it was changing hands at $4.25 overseas. That would make the 32.7 million shares worth about $139 million. ""BankBoston today informed Mercury Finance Co. that recent events regarding Mercury Finance constituted a breach of the provisions of BankBoston's agreement for the exchange of shares of Fidelity Acceptance Corp. for shares of Mercury Finance,"" BankBoston said in a statement. Analysts said BankBoston, a Boston-based banking company, would have little trouble finding another buyer for Fidelity, its auto financing arm. ""At the time they were structuring this deal there were four or five other firms that expressed interest or made bids on Fidelity,"" said Nancy Bush at Brown Brothers Harriman. ""I don't think they're going to get the kind of sweetheart deal they got with Mercury,"" she added. A Mercury Finance spokesman declined to comment on the deal. But the spokesman said the company was interested in talking to James Doyle, the controller who Mercury Finance said had disappeared but who is reportedly cooperating with federal authorities. A Dow Jones news wire report quoted Doyle's attorney as saying Doyle had accused Mercury Finance of a charade and that the controller had not disappeared but was cooperating with the authorities. The attorney was not available and his assistant would not confirm the accuracy of the Dow Jones report. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Chicago declined to comment. Mercury Finance said on Wednesday its 1996 earnings would be restated to $56.7 million from $120.7 million and that earnings for the three prior years would also be adjusted downward, though not as sharply. The problems appeared to stem from unauthorised entries in financial records by its chief accounting officer, Doyle, who the company said had been fired. Mercury Finance also said it was in violation of certain provisions if its loan agreements and that a special committee of directors has been formed to investigate the problems. Mercury Finance said Thursday that the NYSE was seeking more information. Mercury spokesman Joseph Kopec said the exchange wanted ""additional assurance that the numbers in the release Wednesday were reliable."" Kopec said he did not know if the Lake Forest, Ill.-based finance company would issue additional information. Mercury Finance also got hit by at least three lawsuits charging it violated securities laws. Filed in federal court in Chicago on Wednesday and Thursday, the lawsuits alleged the company and some senior officers misrepresented or omitted crucial information about Mercury Finance's earnings for the last three years, lawyers who filed the suits said in statements.

Analysts also said Mercury has not been as forthcoming as other consumer finance companies when providing detailed financial information.

"Mercury Finance Co is likely to spend a tense weekend with its bankers trying to work out arrangments to solve its liquity crisis, the failure of which could force the company to file for bankrupcty protection, analysts and attorney's said. The Lake Forest, Illinois-based auto finance company said Friday it could not raise new commercial paper to repay maturing debt and could not pay $17 million in commercial paper due Friday. A finance company like Mercury makes money on the difference, or spread, between what it pays to borrow money and the higher rates it charges its customers. A finance company without a source of funds is like a retailer without a source of merchandise, analysts noted. ""If you can't fund, you're out of business,"" one equity analyst that follows the company said, requesting anonymity. Some rating agencies, including Standard &amp; Poor's Corp, lowered Mercury's commercial paper to a default rating Friday. ""They're very close to some reorganization, bankruptcy filing, probably a voluntary reorganization,"" said Thomas Kmiotek, analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps Credit Rating Co. He and other analysts noted the company has another $100 million in commercial paper due Thursday, February 6. A Mercury  spokesman did not return repeated calls seeking comment on the company's financing Friday afternoon. Aside from the company's current inability to sell debt, Mercury is also facing a host of shareholder lawsuits, filed after the company said it had to restate its net income over the past four years by a total of about $90 million because of accounting irregularities. Lawsuits do not become a financial liability for the company unless there is a judgment in favor of the shareholders. However, the company's admission of misstatements makes it easier for the sharheolders to prove their case, leaving only the questions of who would have to pay how much, one securities lawyer said. ""Securities laws are very, very simple,"" said Ted Koenig, a partner with Chicago-based lawfirm Holleb &amp; Coff ""If there is an ommission or misstatement of a material fact... there's liabiltiy."" Also, the company's market capitalization plunged by about $2.2 billion Friday, based on the 13 point fall of Mercury's shares and the 172 million shares the company said it had outstanding late last year. That reduces the equity cushion the company has available to show its creditors, Koenig said. But analysts also said the company had about $1 billion in loans receivable on its books at the end of October, 1996 -- an asset to show creditors. ""No one has questioned the validity of the amount of receivables they have on their books or the quality of those receivables,"" Kmiotek said. Also, Mercury has generally been well regarded in the sub-prime credit quality loan business, which could help it negotiate with its banks and continue as a going concern, said analysts and lawyers familiar with the company. Mercury said in a statement it is in discussions with its lenders to satisfy working capital needs, but that it could not predict the outcome of those discussions.

"""The Times They Are a-Changin"" -- Bob Dylan's counter-culture anthem of the 1960's  -- is being used in a commericial for a Canadian bank and some fans are up in arms. The Bank of Montreal is running a television commercial using the American singer's 1964 folk classic to lure baby boomers into the country's third biggest bank. The TV spot shows children running down country roads and across lush fields as a choir sings Dylan's song. The commercial ends with a Bank of Montreal logo and the promise of a big announcement on Oct. 16. The new campaign has drawn fire from Dylan fans angry that a big institution has co-opted this protest song from their youth. But a senior bank official said Dylan's lyrics reflect the bank's desire to change in the 1990s. ""Our view is a bank has to change because the times are changing. We thought the lyrics caught rather nicely the imperative for large institutions, like banks, that they face having to change,"" George Bothwell, senior vice-president of public affairs, said in a telephone interview. Some callers to a morning radio show in Toronto were outraged at the ad campaign. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. played the commercial and Dylan's version, then asked listeners for their reaction. ""I was appalled. The bank failed to understand the spirit of the song. It has so many associations for people our age. I hope they reconsider. They went over the line with this one,"" one female caller said. Another listener said: ""Bob Dylan, I can only say, shame on you."" Dylan still owns the copyright to the song but was unavailable for comment. Some younger callers said aging baby boomers have only themselves to blame. ""I don't know why you're surprised. You had high ideals when you grew up. Then you started making money and buying cars. And all the ideals are no longer convenient so you sold out. Every single one of you. Dylan is just doing what everyone is doing,"" a young listener said. Another caller scoffed at the controversy: ""Baby boomers spare us the crocodile tears. A lot of people have sold out."" One listener found it ironic that in these tough economic times a bank would use a song that warned: ""You better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone.""

"Canada's six biggest banks are poised for a further round of buoyant profits when they begin reporting third-quarter earnings on Tuesday. An improved interest rate picture, higher investment banking and dealing revenues and better loan quality are expected to drive profits in the third quarter ended July 31. On average, earnings for the so-called Big Six are expected to be 15 percent to 20 percent higher than the third quarter of last year, analysts said.   ""I would expect more sectors of the banks to be more profitable than they were in the corresponding quarter of last year,"" Roy Palmer, an analyst with TD Securities, said in a telephone interview. Bank of Montreal and Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada's third and fourth largest banks respectively, kick off the earnings parade on Tuesday. Canada's fifth-biggest bank, Toronto-Dominion Bank, and the smallest, National Bank of Canada, report on Thursday.   The country's top two banks, Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, are scheduled to deliver their results on Thursday, September 5. Despite a recent downturn in financial markets, analysts said securities earnings should be stronger than last year. Canada's brokerage industry is dominated by subsidiaries of the countries major banks. The banks are also expected to benefit from lower loan losses as the industry continues to rebound from disastrous loans in commercial real estate, which collapsed in the late 1980s.   Despite the correction in stocks earlier this summer, bank stocks have remained strong performers. Lower Canadian interest rates have helped push bank stock prices to all-time highs on the Toronto Stock Exchange. ""I think that if the combination of strong profitability couples up with lower interest rates, then it probably will set the backdrop for higher share prices,"" said Susan Cohen, an analyst with Deacon Capital Corp. Analysts said they do not expect any of the banks to raise their dividends during the reporting period.   But the string of record bank profits are expected to yield dividend hikes at the end of the fiscal year. The big banks are on track for a third straight year if record annual profits. The group rang up a combined profit of C$5.17 billion in fiscal 1995 ended October 31, up from C$4.25 billion a year earlier. As for 1997, Palmer said he expects a modest increase in profits.   ""Investment banking is a cyclical business. It may tail off a bit, but there is no sign of a recession yet, so I would think we could get modestly higher earnings next year,"" he said. Bank of Montreal is expected to report a third-quarter profit of C$0.97 per share, up from C$0.93 per share a year ago, according to figures supplied by the International Brokers Estimates Service. Scotiabank's earnings are seen climbing to C$1 per share in the third quarter, up from C$0.86 a share.   Toronto-Dominion Bank is expected to post a C$0.72 per share profit, up slightly from C$0.71 per share in the third quarter of 1995. National Bank's third quarter earnings are forecast to rise to C$0.41 per share from C$0.33 a share a year earlier. CIBC's third quarter results are pegged at C$1.42 a share compared to last year's C$1.13 per share.

"Canada's big six banks, which have long ruled the country's street corners with their vast branch networks, face a challenge to their dominance by the Internet and the rise of new ""virtual banks."" Telephone and computer banking, debit cards and automated teller machines (ATMs) are rapidly transforming Canada's old-style bricks-and-mortar banking system. New technology has eliminated the need for costly branch networks and lured offshore rivals to jump into Canada's $66.5 billion consumer banking market. ""Virtual banks have the potential to send our branch networks the way of the passenger train -- much loved, but seldom used,"" said Bank of Montreal chairman Matthew Barrett in a speech to Toronto's business community. BIG BANKS PREPARE TO MEET THE CHALLENGE The big banks, which dominate regular banking, trust and brokerages in Canada, are marshalling their forces against this cyber-onslaught. Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, Toronto-Dominion Bank and National Bank of Canada are spending millions of dollars to develop new distribution channels and upgrade branches. ING Groep N.V., with nearly $260 billion in assets, is by far the biggest electronic challenger. The Dutch financial services giant dwarfs Royal Bank, the country's biggest financial institution with assets of $147 billion. ING, already a player in Canada's insurance market, plans to offer a wide range of electronic banking services through a new subsidiary, ING Trust Co. of Canada, based in Toronto. ING is keeping a low profile until its application for a trust licence is approved, but bank officials are confident of success where others have failed. In recent years, several foreign banks abandoned Canada because of its restrictive banking laws and stiffer than expected competition from the big domestic banks. ""It would be fair to say that we will be competing on several fronts. It won't be hard to offer better service,"" said Jim Kelly, vice-president of marketing for ING's Canadian operations. ING WILL DRAW ON ITS EUROPEAN EXPERIENCE He said ING will draw on its extensive experience in electronic banking in Europe. Analysts have said ING can use Canada to fine tune its virtual bank before offering similar services in the larger U.S. market. But Kelly said there are no plans yet to take ING's virtual bank south of the border. ""To say we're definitely going to the U.S. would be wrong. To say that we would look at it and see if there is a market opportunity, yes, of course we would,"" he said. Also eyeing Canada's consumer banking market is Citibank Canada, a unit of U.S. giant Citicorp, which is joining with Canadian fund manager AGF Management Ltd., to create a virtual trust company. The venture is Citibank's second foray into Canadian consumer banking after abandoning a bid to establish a traditional branch system in the 1980s. Charles Stuart, country manager of Citibank's consumer banking operations in Canada, said the joint venture gives the bank access to AGF's customer base. Citibank plans to offer customers a full-service banking package, including credit cards, access to ATM service and telephone banking. ""We're not locked into the costs of a bricks-and-mortar structure. So we can serve them through technology and that enables us to price ourselves very competitively,"" he said. The Citibank/AGF venture could set a pattern for other foreign banks seeking to enter Canada with an established customer base, Stuart said. BIG BANKS UNDER PRESSURE FROM LOCAL RIVALS The Big Six banks are pressured by local rivals as well. Last month, Vancouver City Savings Credit Union, the country's biggest credit union with $3.6 billion in assets, applied to open a nationwide branchless bank early next year. While cyber competitors are poised to invade the retail market, Canada's major banks are also on the move. The banks spent a record $1.7 billion on new technology in 1995 and that is expected to reach $1.9 billion by 1998, according to a report by accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young. Much of the money is being poured into alternative delivery channels such as point-of-sale credit and debit cards, ATMs, telephone and computer banking. Cards account for more than a third of all payment transactions in Canada, up from 25 percent a year ago. Telephone and computer transactions are climbing as well. Traditional bank transactions are seen falling to 21 percent in 1998 from 38 percent last year. Among Canadian banks, Royal Bank is the top player in telephone banking with more than 800,000 subscribers. Bank officials expect 40 percent of their eight million customers to be using alternative channels in five years. Last month, Royal Bank joined 14 other North American banks to set up a computer banking network with computer giant IBM in early 1997. All the banks are struggling to decide the future of their branch networks, but CIBC has taken the first steps to overhaul its 1,400 branches. In a recent pilot project, CIBC employed greeters to guide customers to ATMs for their basic banking needs. Bank tellers were retrained to advise customers on such products as mutual funds, loans and mortgages. Billing it as the bank branch of the future, CIBC said transaction costs had fallen dramatically, while customer lineups were much thinner. But by using these low-cost channels, customers will expect a break on service fees, which many consumers complain are too high, Ernst &amp; Young said. Bank of Nova Scotia has taken the acquisition route to boost its Internet services. It recently bought a 10 percent stake in iSTAR Internet Inc., an Internet solutions firm, to help develop new channels and services for the bank. ",DarrenSchuettler

"Far from the hoopla of the U.S. presidential race, Jack Kemp's youngest son, Jimmy, has been tossing footballs on Canada's windswept prairie and relishing his relative anonymity. To football fans in this small western Canada city, Kemp is better known as the quarterback of their beloved Saskatchewan Roughriders than the son of the American Republican vice-presidential candidate. ""It's nice to have your own identity. Up here I'm a Roughriders quarterback and not Jack Kemp's son. I'm proud of my dad, but it's great to be in Canada,"" Kemp, 25, told Reuters during a recent interview at a local sports pub. The well-mannered, cherub-faced Kemp is finishing his third year in the Canadian Football League. He was traded to the Regina team last August after stints with the Montreal Alouettes and the now-defunct San Antonio Texans and Sacramento Gold Miners. As the Nov. 5 election nears, Kemp said he does not get too bothered about his high-profile father. The local press has pretty much left that part of his life private. ""Kemp Just a Normal Guy,"" the Regina Leader-Post newspaper said in a story about the young quarterback when he arrived in town. Before going to Saskatchewan, Kemp joined his family at the Republican convention in San Diego and pondered quitting football to work on his dad's campaign. But the elder Kemp, a former American Football League quarterback who tried out for the CFL's Calgary Stampeders in 1958, urged his son to continue playing. ""We prayed and talked about it and my dad wanted me to take this opportunity that has been given to me,"" said Kemp, who has since enjoyed some success with Saskatchewan. A back-up when he arrived in Regina, Kemp was forced into the spotlight after the club's other quarterbacks fell to injuries. Kemp had the best game of his career this month, passing for three touchdowns in a come-from-behind win against Hamilton. But the team struggled this year and failed to make the playoffs. ""I think I'm good enough to start in this league. I don't think I'm a great quarterback right now, but I need to play more and go through a training camp,"" he said. Jack Kemp has kept a close eye on his son's football career. He flew to Canada three times this season when Jimmy played for Montreal and they talk frequently about football over the telephone. ""He's incredibly encouraging. Even to the point that it gets on my nerves sometimes because he is a very proud father and he thinks anything that I do is great,"" the younger Kemp said. Despite living on the Canadian prairies, Kemp keeps tabs on his father's campaign. He watched the vice presdential debate on CNN and catches the programme ""This Week With David Brinkley"" before a Sunday game. He said he did not have much faith in opinion polls that show the Bob Dole/Jack Kemp ticket lagging far behind the Democratic team of President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. ""I think people can change their minds easily and I think the support for Clinton is soft. I guess it doesn't look good, but I think they've got a chance,"" Kemp said. Kemp does not plan to follow his father into politics, but he does not rule out getting involved at the local level. ""I'm not sure my dad was interested in politics when he was 25. My brother (Jeff) is probably more of a politican than I am, but I do care about the issues,"" he said. ",DarrenSchuettler
"Shares in Canadian brewing and sports firm Molson Cos. Ltd. sank on Monday after its Molson Breweries unit lost the rights to brew Coors Light, Canada's top-selling light beer, in a dispute with Adolph Coors Co.. Investors pounded Molson's stock after an arbitration panel ruled late Friday that Molson reliquished its right to brew and sell Coors products in April 1993 when Miller Brewing Co. acquired a stake in the Canadian brewer. Molson class A stock closed down C$0.75 at C$20.15 on the Toronto Stock Exchange after earlier sinking to C$19.50, just shy of its 52-week low. ""It was a pretty severe ruling and I think it surprised Molson, surprised Coors and, frankly, surprised the street,"" said Mike Palmer, an analyst with Loewen, Ondaatje, McCutcheon Ltd. The panel said Molson breached its licensing agreement with Coors by allowing Miller, a unit of Philip Morris Cos. Inc., to buy a 20 percent stake without Coors' consent. Molson Breweries is also owned 40 percent each by Molson Cos and Australia's Foster's Brewing Group Ltd.. The panel ordered Molson to pay Coors all the profits it earned from selling Coors beer since 1993, an amount that has yet to be determined. Coors brands produced by Molson -- Coors Light and Original Coors -- account for 8 percent of its sales volume. Coors Light is the dominant light beer in Canada, commanding a 5 to 5.5 percent share of the beer market. Analysts said Molson can ill afford to lose a profitable brand as it battles rival Labatt Brewing Co. Ltd. in a domestic beer market that has been flat for several years. ""You start losing volume and it has a significant impact on your profits. It's very important to Molson to negotiate a deal with Coors,"" said Palmer. While Molson officials said they are willing to negotiate a new licensing agreement, Coors was keeping its options open. ""What we need to do is go through the panel's ruling and understand all of the aspects of the ruling and then analyze what our options are,"" said Coors spokesman Jon Goldman. He declined to outline Coors' options for the Canadian market. But analysts speculated that Coors could cut a richer deal with Molson, ship product directly to Canada or buy a local brewer to produce Coors in Canada. ""The easiest option is to negotiate a deal with Molson. They've had a big win here so it's time to kiss and make up,"" said Palmer. If there is a new deal, Coors will likely seek more control over its brands and higher royalties from Molson, said Barry Joslin, Molson's vice-president of corporate affairs. If Molson cannot negotiate a new licensing agreement, Joslin said the brewer would consider its options, including launching a new light brand. ",DarrenSchuettler

"Toronto, Canada's biggest city and financial capital, is bracing for a near shutdown Friday when protesters hit the streets against deep budget cuts by Ontario's Conservative government. The so-called ""Days of Protest"" on Friday and Saturday are shaping up to be the biggest labour protest in Canada since the Winnipeg General Strike in 1919 in which one person died and 30 were injured after a confrontation with police and the army. In a bid to paralyse this city of 2.2 million people, organisers hope to close businesses and disrupt services, including underground trains and Toronto's Pearson Airport, the country's busiest airport. Thousands of unionized workers, civil servants and activists will picket outside the Toronto Stock Exchange, government offices, corporate headquarters and factories. ""I must tell you to prepare for days of inconvenience and frustration Friday and Saturday,"" Alan Tonks, chairman of Metro Toronto, said in a letter to residents on Thursday. Ironically, the labour chaos comes as Toronto basks in the glow of being chosen by Fortune magazine as the world's best city for quality of life. The protesters are furious with the government's plans to cut spending by C$8 billion ($5.9 billion) to wipe out a huge deficit by the turn of the century. Since sweeping to power in 1995 promising a right-wing revolution in Canada's most populous province, the Conservatives have revamped labour laws, slashed welfare payments, introduced workfare and announced plans to close hospitals and trim education budgets. ""We want to put pressure on the government and its corporate supporters that we're not going to accept this anymore,"" Linda Torney, co-chairwoman of the ""Days of Protest"", said in a telephone interview. Premier Mike Harris, who has been dubbed ""Newt of the North"" in reference to Republican U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, vowed the protests will not stall his ""Common Sense Revolution."" City officials were bracing for a disruption of Toronto's bus and subway services, which handle about 1 million commuters a day. Transit officials on Thursday won a partial injunction against picketing at subway stations. GO Transit, the train service that links suburban communities to Toronto, warned commuters that ""service may be delayed, adjusted, interrupted or even cancelled."" Air travellers can also expect delays at Pearson Airport, which handles about 65,000 passengers a day, said airport spokesman Bruce Reid. A Canadian court ruled Wednesday that picketers cannot interfere with essential airport workers, but can set up informational pickets. Airlines have promised to re-schedule flights if there are significant delays. Meanwhile, several major manufacturers have cancelled day shifts. De Havilland Inc., a unit of transportation firm Bombardier Inc., said 6,200 employees at its Toronto aircraft plant will be off the job Friday. The protest will not affect General Motors Corp.'s Canadian unit, which is getting back to work after a nearly three-week strike ended earlier this week. The Breeders' Cup, a major international horse-racing event on Saturday, will not be affected by the protest. On Toronto's Bay Street, the heart of Canada's financial community, traders not lucky enough to get a scarce hotel room are planning to sleep in their offices. ""Some essential people will be in the office. They might grab a couch or a sleeping bag,"" one broker said. Other firms are sending their employees to offices outside Toronto or telling them to work from home. Many workers are expected to take the day off. The Toronto Stock Exchange, Canada's biggest stock exchange, is planning a ""business-as-usual day,"" despite a large rally planned outside the exchange. ",DarrenSchuettler
"Anti-government protests swept across Canada's biggest city Friday as demonstrators in Toronto shut down the transit system, disrupted businesses and tried to break into the Toronto Stock Exchange. Thousands of union workers, civil servants and other citizens descended on government offices, transit stations and factories across the city, organisers said. Over 1 million commuters stayed at home, walked, drove or cycled to work after the city's subway and bus services were shutdown, officials estimated. City officials said transit services would resume early Saturday. But picketers did not disrupt commuter trains from Toronto's bedroom communities or interrupt service at Pearson Airport, the country's busiest. Instead of the traffic jams on the city expressways which had been expected, ""It was like a Sunday afternoon,"" one city official said. Toronto police said there were no major acts of violence, though a few people were arrested, mostly for misconduct. The so-called Days of Protest was organised by labour unions to protest deep budget cuts by Ontario's Conservative government affecting many of this city of 2.2 million people. Some critics said the protest did not succeed. ""Today's protest was a flop. Yes. They inconvenienced a lot of people, but they failed to shut down the city,"" said Colin Brown of Ontarians for Responsible Government, a right-wing lobby group. ""Hundreds of thousands of people didn't come to work and that is what counts,"" said Aleda O'Connor, a spokeswoman for the organisers. Ironically, the labour unrest came after Fortune magazine called Toronto the city with the world's best quality of life. Most of the protests were peaceful, but hundreds of demonstrators tried to smash into the Toronto Stock Exchange, a symbol of the business community that has supported the government's tough fiscal policies. Protesters chanted, ""Shut it down, shut it down,"" as they pounded on the glass doors of Canada's biggest stock market. One man wearing a mask and combat fatigues was seen hurling himself against the doors. Riot police were moved into the vicinity of stock exchange, but did not intervene. Rally organisers later moved the raucous group away from the doors of the exchange. ""We've come to the place where the real power is ... They get their power and strength from inside this building,"" Jim Stanford, an economist for the Canadian Auto Workers, told hundreds of protesters outside the exchange. In the days leading up to the protest, a siege mentality gripped Toronto's Bay Street, the heart of Canada's financial community. At least one brokerage firm flew traders to its offices in New York and Montreal, while other brokers slept in hotel rooms or in their offices overnight. Other companies, including the Globe and Mail newspaper, hired boats to ferry employees across Lake Ontario from nearby communities. The demonstrators expressed fury at Ontario Premier Mike Harris' plans to cut spending by C$8 billion ($5.9 billion) to wipe out a big budget deficit by the turn of the century. Since coming to power in 1995 on the promise of a right-wing revolution in Canada's most populous province, the Conservatives have revamped labour laws, slashed welfare payments and required recipients to work, and announced plans to close hospitals and cut education budgets. ""These cuts that Harris made are hurting the workers. This is part of the polarisation that is happening in Ontario. The anger is going to grow and grow,"" Syd Ryan, president of the Ontario division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, told picketers outside a government building. Harris, who has been dubbed ""Newt of the North"" in reference to Republican U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, has vowed the protests will not stall his ""Common Sense Revolution."" ""Will they discourage us from creating more jobs? No. Discourage us from workfare? No. That's what we were elected to do and I don't expect that most of the public want us to change from that agenda,"" Harris told reporters. The Conservatives, who hold their annual convention in Toronto this weekend, have seen their popularity hold at about 50 percent in recent opinion polls. Many commuters took the delays in stride. ""I see the protesters have a point, but I think it's going to inconvenience a lot of people who don't have any other choice,"" said John Ivarey. Police said one man was charged with a weapons offence after allegedly threatening picketers with a baseball bat and five protesters were charged with public mischief. Several major manufacturers cancelled day shifts. De Havilland Inc., a unit of transportation firm Bombardier Inc., said 6,200 employees at its Toronto aircraft plant would be off the job Friday.

But picketers failed to disrupt commuter trains from Toronto's bedroom communities or interrupt service at Pearson Airport, the country's busiest airport. The Toronto Stock Exchange had expected protesters to disrupt trading, but Canada's biggest stock market opened as usual. At least one brokerage firm flew traders to its Montreal office to work today, while other brokers slept in hotel rooms or in their offices overnight. The stock exchange has been targeted for a major rally later today. The protesters are furious with Premier Mike Harris' plans to cut spending by C$8 billion ($5.9 billion) to wipe out a huge deficit by the turn of the century. Since sweeping to power in 1995 promising a right-wing revolution in Canada's most populous province, the Conservatives have revamped labor laws, slashed welfare payments, introduced workfare and announced plans to close hospitals and trim education budgets. ""These cuts that Harris made are hurting the workers. This is part of the polarization that is happening in Ontario. The anger is going to grow and grow,"" Sid Ryan, president of the Ontario division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, told picketers outside a government building. But Harris, who has been dubbed ""Newt of the North"" in reference to Republican U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, has vowed the protests will not stall his ""Common Sense Revolution."" Despite the opposition to his government, the Conservatives' popularity continues to hold around 50 percent in opinion polls. Protesters waved placards and temporarily blocked cars from entering government parking lots, but Toronto police said there were no major incidents of violence. One man was charged with a weapons offence after allegedly threatening pickets with a baseball bat outside a bus garage. There also were skirmishes outside a postal station. Many commuters took the delays in stride. ""I see the protesters have a point, but I think it's going to inconvenience a lot of people who don't have any other choice,"" said John Ivarey. Meanwhile, several major manufacturers canceled day shifts. De Havilland Inc., a unit of transportation firm  Bombardier Inc., said 6,200 employees at its Toronto aircraft plant will be off the job Friday. The protest will not affect General Motors Corp.'s Canadian unit, which is getting back to work after a nearly three-week strike ended earlier this week. ",DarrenSchuettler
"Protesters hit Toronto streets on Friday, paralysing rush-hour subway trains and closing businesses in Canada's biggest city to protest deep budget cuts by Ontario's Conservative government. Underground subway and bus service ground to a halt in this city of 2.2 million people, forcing about one million commuters to walk, drive or cycle to work or stay home.

"The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Index reached its 50th record close of 1996 on Thursday and broke the 5600 barrier for the first time. The TSE 300 Composite Index rose 8.01 points to close at 5598.82, surpassing a streak of 45 record finishes in 1987. The Index also breached the 5600 barrier, setting an intraday high of 5601.88. ""It's just another record in a string of more to come. This won't be the last,"" said Fred Ketchen, senior vice-president and director of equity trading for ScotiaMcLeod Inc, a unit of Bank of Nova Scotia. Toronto's record-setting run was led by banking, communications, conglomerates and technology issues. Of the TSE's 14 sub-groups, 10 finished higher. The rally was restrained by 162-point loss in golds. Trading was brisk with 113.8 million shares exchanging hands for a value of C$1.6 billion ($1.2 billion). Advancing stocks outnumbered declines 538 to 434 with 294 issues unchanged. Traditionally, October has been a scary month for investors who remember the massive crash of 1987. ""This is the time when everything is supposed to fall apart, but it has been a rather strong month,"" Ketchen said. * Bank of Nova Scotia and Royal Bank of Canada set all-time highs as the bank group continued their climb since summer. Scotiabank closed up 0.45 at 42.25 after reaching a 52-week high of 42.40.

COMEX gold futures slumped for a second straight session on Thursday. * Molson Cos Ltd jumped 0.40 to 20.50 after its brewing unit, Molson Breweries, reached an interim deal with U.S. beermaker Adolph Coors Co on the sale of Coors beer in Canada. An arbitration panel two weeks ago ruled that Molson Breweries breached its licensing deal by allowing Miller Brewing Co., a unit of Philip Morris Cos Inc, to buy a 20 percent stake without Coors' consent in 1993.

"The Montreal Canadiens, the most storied franchise in the National Hockey League, were engulfed in sale rumours Friday, which drew a fierce denial from its owner, Molson Cos. Ltd. Canadian newspapers reported that a consortium led by former Canadiens general manager and Hall of Famer Serge Savard was assembling a bid for the team, winner of a record 24 Stanley Cup championships since 1916. Citing unidentified sources, Toronto's Globe and Mail newspaper reported that talks with Molson had been under way for several days. ""Don't take this story lightly. There's a very good chance that it could happen,"" wrote sports columnist Marty York, quoting a source at Molson. Rejean Tremblay, a columnist for the Montreal newspaper La Presse, reported similar rumours. Molson is the sole owner of the Canadiens and their new arena, the $150 million Molson Centre. It also owns 40 percent of Canada's biggest brewer, Molson Breweries. ""The company has not approached anyone on this subject and no one has approached us. Neither the hockey club nor the Molson Centre are for sale,"" Molson Chief Executive Norman Seagram said in a statement. Analysts speculated that the Canadiens and the arena could fetch up to $300 million. Savard, who played for Montreal from 1967-1981 and was fired last season after 13 years as the team's general manager, was unavailable for comment on Friday. Selling the Canadiens would be a dramatic about-face for Molson. The company said four months ago the club was a key part of its heritage. ""At the Molson companies, we have two legacy assets, Molson Breweries and the Montreal Canadiens,"" Seagram told shareholders at the annual meeting in June. Sports plays a huge role in selling beer in Canada and the Molson name is intertwined with Canadiens hockey. Aside from putting its name on a new arena, Molson Breweries is a major sponsor of NHL television broadcasts in Canada. The Molson family sold the club in 1971 to Peter Bronfman, whose cousins control the Seagram beverage empire. Molson Cos. reacquired the team in 1978.

"Toronto stocks ended weaker amid profit taking on Friday, but not before Canada's biggest stock market had struggled to a new intraday high.

The TSE posted its 50th record close on Thursday and also broke through the key 5600 barrier. The TSE managed to hit an intraday high of 5606 before turning lower on the day. Toronto's nine weak sectors included sharp losses in consumer products, base metals, communications and pipelines. The five strong groups were led by financial services. Bank stocks rallied along with firmer North American bond markets and on expectations for another Bank of Canada rate cut next weak. Analysts said the strong Canadian dollar has given the central bank enough leeway to lower rates. The Canadian currency closed stronger at C$1.3335 (US$0.7499) on Friday, the strongest the unit has been since October, 1995. --- HOT STOCKS --- * Bre-X Minerals Ltd. led active stocks, sinking 1.25 to 21.15 on 4.25 million shares.

"U.S. mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments said on Saturday that Canadian regulators were investigating trades made by Veronika Hirsch, the star manager of their new Canadian equity fund. Hirsch's 27-city road show to promote Fidelity's True North fund has been postponed as a result of the regulatory review, said a spokesman for the Boston-based mutual fund company. The tour was scheduled to begin on Monday. ""Veronika Hirsch ... was recently contacted by a regulatory agency about her personal investments before she joined Fidelity,"" Chethan Lakshman, a spokesman for Fidelity's Canadian subsidiary, Fidelity Investments Canada Ltd., said in a telephone interview. ""At this time it is appropriate to postpone the tour and we're hopeful that the regulatory review of her trading activity will result in a favorable conclusion,"" Lakshman said. He did not identify the regulator, but Canadian newspapers reported on Saturday that the British Columbia Securities Commission was looking into the matter. Lakshman said Hirsch was not available for interviews and he was unsure of her whereabouts. The controversy is over Hirsch's investments in a Vancouver-based exploration firm, Oliver Gold Corp., earlier this year while she was a high-profile fund manager with AGF Management Ltd. in Toronto. Hirsch, a flamboyant stock picker compared to her sedate peers in Canada's mutual fund industry, was hired by Fidelity with much fanfare in August after only 10 months at AGF. Fidelity is conducting its own review of Hirsch's actions before she joined the company. During her brief stint at AGF, Hirsch bought 65,000 special warrants of Oliver Gold for herself through a private placement in April, according to statements filed with the British Columbia Securities Commission and reported by Vancouver-based Canada Stockwatch, a newsletter which tracks Canadian stocks. Hirsch paid C$1.53 ($1.14) per warrant. A short time later, the AGF Growth &amp; Income Fund managed by Hirsch bought 295,000 special warrants, according to the filings with the B.C. commission. The AGF fund paid over double the price, C$3.60 ($2.69) per warrant, paid by Hirsch. Another related issue is whether Hirsch used a false address in British Columbia to buy the Oliver Gold shares. Canadian newspapers have reported that the home address of a Vancouver stock analyst and institutional salesman was used. Hirsch is a resident of Ontario and the Oliver Gold stock was only available to British Columbia residents. AGF chief executive officer Warren Goldring has said Hirsch broke company rules by failing to report her personal investment in Oliver Gold. He added Hirsch could have been fired if AGF had known about the trades. The controversy swirling around Hirsch has dominated the business pages of Canadian newspapers, but Lakshman said the publicity has not hurt Fidelity's efforts to build a higher profile in Canadian equities management.

"Toronto stocks soared to new heights on Wednesday, powered by a rally in bank shares as foreign investors stampeded into Canada's financial markets, lured by falling interest rates and a recovering Canadian economy. Shares in Canada's big six banks hit 52-week highs on the Toronto Stock Exchange, propelling the country's biggest stock market to its 53rd record close of 1996. The Canadian dollar has also surged this week, hitting its strongest level since October 30, 1995. Declining interest rates, low inflation and falling budget deficits have combined to make Canada the flavor of the month, economists said. ""Overall, foreign investors have just become enamored with Canada as a place for investment,"" Michael Gregory, an economist with Lehman Brothers, said in a telephone interview. The Toronto Stock Exchange jumped 85 points to close around 5749, fueled by brisk action in interest-rate sensitive issues such as banks and utilities. The key 300 Index has gained more than 20 percent this year, compared to about 19 percent for the Dow Jones Average and 16 percent for the Standard &amp; Poors 500. The Bank of Canada is expected to ease interest rates again as early as this week. The central bank has cut rates 19 times since May 1995 in a bid to revive a sluggish economy. Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen said on Wednesday that Canada's improving economy gives the central bank more latitude to set Canadian rates independent of U.S. rates. He added Canada is now in a better position to withstand a hike in U.S. rates than it has been in recent years. ""The economic outlook is favorable. We will soon see signs of the payoff for the difficult restructuring decisions taken in both the private and public sectors,"" Thiessen said. After several years of belt tightening, Canadian governments have either balanced their budgets or are on track to wipe out huge deficits. Canada's 1.2 percent inflation rate is one of the lowest in the world and less than half the U.S. rate. Several Canadian banks cut residential mortgage rates on Wednesday to levels not seen in about three decades. Gregory said he expected Canada to continue to outperform the United States on the rate front and that offshore investors recognized that. ""I think investors are coming to terms with the fact that Canadian interest rates -- because of low inflation and improving currency prospects -- should be below U.S. rates,"" he said. ""Many investors are jumping on that and the Canadian dollar is undervalued. It's cheap,"" Gregory said. The Canadian currency closed around C$1.3312 (US$0.7512) on Wednesday after trading around C$1.3300 earlier in the session. The dollar broke through C$1.3300 on Tuesday, its strongest level since October 1995. In stocks, the country's big six banks have been big beneficiaries of favorable interest rates and the overseas scramble to buy Canadian stocks. The TSE's financial services group jumped 2.5 percent on Wednesday after soaring three percent on Tuesday. The sector has gained nearly 1,400 points since September. Declining interest rates make bank lending more profitable and bank dividends more attractive for investors. Soaring bank profits have also lured investors. The major banks report their year-end results in a few weeks and are on track for a third straight year of record profits. Recent listings on the New York Stock Exchange have given Canadian banks a higher profile in the United States where they are considered cheap compared to U.S. bank stocks. New York-based Morgan Stanley issued a bullish recommendation on two Canadian banks on Tuesday and predicted a strong fourth quarter for the entire group. ",DarrenSchuettler
"Veronika Hirsch, the flamboyant Canadian stock picker hired recently to spearhead Fidelity Investments' drive to dominate the Canadian market, has been removed from her fund as she is probed by Canadian regulators. The dramatic move -- just three months after Canada's so-called ""Fund Diva"" joined the mutual fund giant -- is a blow to Fidelity's expansion efforts in Canada, analysts said. Hirsch, who was unavailable to comment, is embroiled in a controversy over personal trades she made before joining Fidelity, the world's biggest mutual fund company. Her investments earlier this year in a small Vancouver company, Oliver Gold Corp., grabbed headlines and attracted the attention of the British Columbia Securities Commission. Late Wednesday, Fidelity ousted Hirsch from her portfolio and said her status was ""under discussion."" Fidelity also took the unprecedented step of offering clients their money back without penalty. The fund has grown to C$190 million ($143 million) in assets since it was launched amid much fanfare on Sept. 23. Fidelity's head office in Boston declined to comment and referred all calls to its Canadian subsidiary. ""We acknowledge that it is highly unusual for a fund to change portfolio managers so quickly after its launch. This fee recovery programme is a proactive and voluntary response on our part to maintain investors' goodwill,"" Fidelity Canada spokesman Chethan Lakshman told Reuters. Fidelity vigorously defended Hirsch when the controversy first broke several weeks ago. But it cancelled a 27-city road show last week when regulators contacted Hirsch. At issue is her purchase of 65,000 special warrants of Oliver Gold through a private placement while she was a fund manager with AGF Management Ltd. in Toronto. Hirsch paid C$1.53 ($1.15) per warrant, according to filings with the British Columbia Securities Commission and reported by Stockwatch, a Canadian investment publication. Shortly afterward, Hirsch's AGF Growth &amp; Income Fund bought 295,000 special warrants at more than double that price. Analysts said regulators are expected to review whether the trades constitute ""front running"", a practice whereby a fund manager tries to profit personally by buying securities he or she intends to buy later for the fund. Another related issue is whether Hirsch, a resident of Ontario, used an address in British Columbia to buy the Oliver Gold shares, which were only offered to B.C. residents. Lakshman contended the controversy has not damaged Fidelity's reputation or expansion plans in Canada. But analysts saw the publicity as damaging as Fidelity gears up for the critical year-end sale of retirement savings plans. ""They look kind of foolish being the ones associated with this situation. I don't think it helps their bid to become the dominant player in Canada by any stretch of the imagination,"" one industry analyst said. The Hirsch case comes as Canadians are pouring billions of dollars into mutual funds. Over the last six years, investment has jumped seven-fold to C$180 billion ($136 billion). Fidelity wants a bigger share of the Canadian market, where it ranks ninth with C$7 billion ($5.2 billion) in assets, behind leader Investors Group, with C$22 billion ($16 million). To quarterback its effort in Canada, Fidelity poached Hirsch, a high-profile stock picker with AGF, for a rumoured C$2 million ($1.5 million) signing bonus in August. Her meteoric rise to celebrity status began when she joined AGF in October 1995 after a successful but low-profile stint at Prudential Insurance Co. of America. A multi-million advertising campaign put Hirsch's face on television screens across the country. She soon rivalled celebrity stock guru Frank Mersch at Altamira Management Ltd. as the country's best-known fund manager. When Hirsch jumped to Fidelity, her blood-red nails and leather outfits appeared an uncomfortable fit with Fidelity's ultra-conservative culture, but the hiring was considered a major coup within the industry. At the time, Fidelity Canada President Kevin Kelly said: ""Veronika is one of the country's top equity managers with an outstanding track record and reputation."" Kelly was unavailable for comment on Thursday. Industry critics argue that the Hirsch case raises key questions about the fiduciary responsibility of fund managers to their clients. It also highlights the jumble of standards governing the personal investing of Canadian money managers. Altamira has tough rules restricting managers from investing in open-ended mutual funds, short-term government bonds and treasury bills after a controversy involving one of its fund managers. But some industry observers say the entire industry should adopt tougher U.S. guidelines. ",DarrenSchuettler

Fidelity wants a bigger share of the Canadian market, where it ranks ninth with C$7 billion ($5.2 billion) in assets, behind leader Investors Group, with C$22 billion ($16 million). To quarterback its effort in Canada, Fidelity poached Hirsch, a high-profile stock picker with AGF, for a rumored C$2 million ($1.5 million) signing bonus in August. Her meteoric rise to celebrity status began when she joined AGF in October 1995 after a successful but low-profile stint at Prudential Insurance Co. of America. A multi-million advertising campaign put Hirsch's face on television screens across the country. She soon rivalled celebrity stock guru Frank Mersch at Altamira Management Ltd. as the country's best-known fund manager. When Hirsch jumped to Fidelity, her blood-red nails and leather outfits appeared an uncomfortable fit with Fidelity's ultra-conservative culture, but the hiring was considered a major coup within the industry. At the time, Fidelity Canada President Kevin Kelly said: ""Veronika is one of the country's top equity managers with an outstanding track record and reputation."" Kelly was unavailable for comment on Thursday. Industry critics argue that the Hirsch case raises key questions about the fiduciary responsibility of fund managers to their clients. It also highlights the jumble of standards governing the personal investing of Canadian money managers. Altamira has tough rules restricting managers from investing in open-ended mutual funds, short-term government bonds and treasury bills after a controversy involving one of its fund managers. But some industry observers say the entire industry should adopt tougher U.S. guidelines. ",DarrenSchuettler
"Stock in Canada's big banks tumbled on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Tuesday after a Canadian brokerage cut its recommendations on the high-flying bank group. CIBC Wood Gundy, a unit of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, cut its ratings on four of the so-called Big Six banks. Montreal-based National Bank of Canada, the smallest of the six major banks, received the only buy recommendation. ""We are lowering our recommendations on the group of Canadian bank stocks, moving from three buys to only one buy,"" said CIBC Wood Gundy analyst Mark Maxwell. Canadian bank stocks have soared to all-time highs in recent months, with Toronto's bank index up 46 percent in 1996. But the group's valuation multiples are now averaging 1.7 times book value -- closing the gap between Canadian bank stocks and their U.S. counterparts, Maxwell said in a report to institutional investors. Toronto's financial services group plummeted 145 points, or 2.7 percent, in heavy trading on Tuesday. Bank of Montreal, which Maxwell reduced to hold from accumulate, fell C$1.55 ($1.16) to C$42.15 ($31.63) on 1.5 million shares. Bank of Nova Scotia dropped C$1.85 ($1.38) to C$44.50 ($33.39) on 995,000 shares after Maxwell recommended investors reduce their Scotiabank holdings. Royal Bank of Canada, which was cut to accumulate from buy, surrendered C$1.30 ($0.75) to C$46 ($34.52) on 2.9 million shares. Canada's biggest bank is the group's valuation leader with a multiple of 2.0 times book value, Maxwell said. CIBC dropped C$1.70 ($1.27) to C$57.25 ($43) on 700,000 shares. Maxwell did not assign a ranking to CIBC. Toronto-Dominion Bank sank C$1.15 (86 cents) to C$33.40 ($25) on volume of 1.3 million shares after it was lowered to accumulate from buy. ""Of the five largest banks, our top pick would remain TD (Toronto-Dominion), since it is most likely to continue to exercise its share repurchase programme, even at current multiples, reflecting its superior capital strength,"" Maxwell said. National Bank of Canada fell 55 cents Canadian (41 cents) to C$13.35 ($10) on 1.05 million shares despite having the only buy recommendation of the group. But some stock strategists remained bullish on Canadian banks. They said the group was still popular among foreign investors seeking to jump into the Canadian market, lured by interest rates at 40-year lows and a recovering economy. ""Foreigners are attracted to Canadian investments and one of the best areas they can participate in is the banking sector,"" said Ira Katzin, an investment advisor with RBC Dominion Securities.

"The battle for Canada's Altamira Management Ltd. took a surprising twist on Wednesday when U.S. investment firm T.A. Associates Inc. launched a rival C$767 million ($572 million) bid for Canada's 12th-largest mutual fund company. Boston-based T.A. Associates said it is offering C$38 ($28) per share for Altamira, which is also the target of a C$32 ($24) a share bid from Manufacturers Life Insurance Co. Ltd. of Toronto. The competing offer came as two major Altamira shareholders prepared to go to court to block Manulife's C$660 million ($492 million) takeover bid for Altamira. The legal action was postponed on Wednesday after the feuding parties agreed to try to negotiate a settlement. The shareholders, who together control 41.5 percent of Altamira, have said Manufacturers Life's offer is too low and that they were negotiating with another potential bidder. T.A. Associates, which emerged as the mystery bidder Wednesday, is one of the largest private equity investors in the United States. ""We believe that our proposed transaction serves the purposes of all of the parties, and, more importantly, is in the long-term best interests of the unitholders of the Altamira funds,"" Andrews McLane, T.A. Associates' manager director, said in a letter to Altamira shareholders. He said the offer was made on behalf of private equity partnerships managed by the Boston firm and other institutional investors. Under the terms of the offer, Manulife would have to agree to release a group of employee shareholders from a promise to tender their shares to its offer. Manulife already owns 30.5 percent of Altamira and has the support of a group of 40 Altamira fund managers and employees. ""We do not believe that this highly tentative proposal justifies any delay in implementation of the transaction we have agreed upon,"" Manulife said in a statement. The bid is fiercely opposed by Montreal-based Almiria Capital Corp., which owns another 30.5 percent slice of Altamira, and a group led by Altamira Chairman Ron Meade. The lawsuit launched by Almiria and the management group Tuesday was scheduled to proceed Wednesday in an Ontario court. But the court action was postponed after a last-minute accord by all parties to try to negotiate a settlement. ""The parties reached an agreement to proceed as quickly as possible to a final determination of the issues and all parties intend that Altamira will continue its business in the ordinary course,"" a joint statement said. Manulife spokesperson Nancy Evans said there was no connection between the agreement and the appearance of T.A. Associates' rival offer for Altamira. Altamira manages Canada's biggest no-load mutual fund with about C$6.2 billion ($4.6 billion) in mutual fund assets. Manulife is the country's largest insurance company with about C$50 billion ($37 billion) in assets. ",DarrenSchuettler
"Two major shareholders in Canada's Altamira Management Ltd. have set a mid-December deadline to resume their court action to block a C$660 million takeover bid by Manufacturers Life Insurance Co. Ltd. if negotiations to settle the dispute fail. ""The preference is to resolve this as quickly as possible,"" said Rick Leckner, a spokesman for Almiria Capital Corp. which owns 30.5 percent of Altamira. ""If it has to come to that (a court battle) -- sad as it may be -- it still has to be considered. But the ideal solution is a negotiated one,"" he said in a telephone interview.

But the bid is opposed as too low by Montreal-based Almiria and a group led by Altamira Chairman Ron Meade which holds about 11 percent of Altamira. The lawsuit launched by Almiria and Meade's group Tuesday was scheduled to proceed Wednesday in an Ontario court. But the feuding parties agreed to try and negotiate a settlement. Leckner said on Thursday that those talks have not yet begun. The court action is set to resume on December 18. T.A. Associates is one of the largest private equity investors in the United States.

"The Canadian Football League is set to hold what many fear may be its last Grey Cup championship on Sunday after a chaotic, money-losing season. The championship between the Toronto Argonauts -- led by former Boston College star quarterback Doug Flutie -- and the Edmonton Eskimos, is the 84th league title game. But some wonder if there will be a Grey Cup next year. Despite returning to its Canadian roots this year after a failed U.S. expansion, the CFL is dripping red ink. All but one of its nine clubs will lose money, due to small crowds and cash bailouts to keep teams in Ottawa, Montreal and Vancouver afloat during the 1996 season. The 120-year-old Ottawa Rough Riders franchise folded earlier this month at the end of the regular season. So precarious are the league's finances that the cash-strapped Eskimos could not afford to fly players' wives to the Grey Cup game in Hamilton, Ontario, 42 miles (68 km) southwest of Toronto. ""The LAST Grey Cup?"" asked the Toronto Star, Canada's biggest newspaper, in a front page story on Friday. Some say the CFL needs the bigger and richer National Football League to survive. CFL Commissioner Larry Smith said he is interested in ""building a relationship"" with the NFL, but that the CFL will not become a Triple A minor league. ""I have no interest in a farm system. If we could have some developmental relationships like we've done in the past with guys like Warren Moon and Joe Theismann, then that would be great,"" Smith said in a telephone interview. Moon and Theismann were star CFL quarterbacks in the 1970s and 1980s before jumping to the NFL. ""What we have been doing is exploring some ideas on ways we could possibly work together. But we have not reached an agreement on anything at this point,"" said Greg Aiello, director of communications for the NFL. CFL purists fear closer ties with the NFL would threaten the distinctiveness of Canadian-style football. Canada's game closely resembles the U.S. brand, but there are a few key differences. The playing field is longer and wider. Canadian teams get only three downs instead of four to gain 10 yards and keep possession of the ball. There are 12 players a side compared to 11, and single points are awarded for missed field goals not run out of the end zone. Football writer and former CFL player Frank Cosentino said the NFL could help pay the salaries of developing players, but that closer ties could alienate the CFL's remaining followers. But fans already appear to have turned off the CFL. Average attendance slipped to 22,095 this year from 24,400 in 1995, despite a slick new ""Radically Canadian"" marketing campaign trumpeting the league's Canadian heritage. In major markets such as Toronto and Vancouver, the league is considered second-rate. A 1995 pre-season NFL game between the Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills in Toronto drew about 60,000 fans. This year, the Argonauts, despite the league's best record of 15-3, averaged just 20,400 fans. Unless there is a late surge in ticket sales, the Grey Cup game will fall short of a sell-out. ""The way it looks now we may have about 36,000. We have capacity for about 40,000,"" organiser Matthew Moreland said on Friday. It is a far cry from the 1950s and 1960s when the CFL attracted huge crowds and players such as Ron Lancaster, Joe Kapp, Angelo Mosca and Sam Etcheverry were household names. Players now rarely stay long enough to become known by fans. Poor marketing has also left the CFL far behind other sports in the race for the public's entertainment dollars. In a bid to save the league, Smith has proposed a restructuring plan to cut costs. All clubs have until January to secure enough season-ticket sales to operate next year. Smith is confident there will be eight teams next year, but he said the CFL was prepared to operate with fewer. There will likely be no football in Ottawa, next year after the league revoked the franchise in Canada's capital from Chicago businessman Horn Chen. The future is also cloudy for the Montreal Alouettes -- who won the Grey Cup last year as the Baltimore Stallions, but lured few fans this season -- and the British Columbia Lions, who are in receivership.

"Quarterback Doug Flutie led the Toronto Argonauts to a 43-37 victory over the Edmonton Eskimos and the championship of the endangered Canadian Football League on Sunday. In what may have been the last Grey Cup game, the Argonauts overcame a driving snowstorm and a gritty Eskimo club to capture their first CFL championship since 1991. Flutie, named the Grey Cup's most valuable player, silenced critics who labelled him a fair-weather quarterback after the Argonauts lost last year's bitterly cold championship game to the Baltimore Stallions. The former Boston College star and Heisman Trophy winner as U.S. college player of the year also won the CFL's most outstanding player award this week after leading the Argonauts to a 15-3 season, the league's best record. ""That's the full package. That's what has been missing the last few years,"" Flutie said after winning his second Grey Cup since 1992 when he was with the Calgary Stampeders. Flutie completed 22 of 35 passes for 302 yards and made a 10-yard scramble for a touchdown. Canadian newspapers have reported that the CFL's new salary cap may prevent Toronto from paying Flutie's annual salary of $1 million Canadian (about $750,000 U.S.) -- the highest in the league. The snowy, slippery contest was a typical Grey Cup in which weather played a critical role. The steady snowfall blanketed Hamilton's Ivor Wynne Stadium for most of the game and kept field crews busy. Despite the conditions, it was the second-highest scoring Grey Cup game. The highlights included a 91-yard kick return by the Eskimos' Henry ""Gizmo"" Williams which set a new Grey Cup record. The championship capped a chaotic, money-losing season which left many fans wondering if they will see the venerable Grey Cup next year. ""After a game like this, it would be a real shame if the CFL folded,"" said parka-clad Bob Forbes, one of 38,595 spectators who huddled against the weather. Despite returning to its Canadian roots this year after a failed expansion into the United States, the CFL is dripping red ink. The Grey Cup was not a sell-out, and all but one of the CFL's nine clubs will lose money, due to dwindling crowds and cash bailouts to keep teams in Ottawa, Montreal and Vancouver afloat during the 1996 season. The 120-year-old Ottawa Rough Riders franchise folded in Canada's capital at the end of the regular season. The cash-strapped Eskimos could not afford to fly players' wives to the game.

"Canada's Big Six banks are poised for a third straight year of record profits when they begin reporting year-end earnings on Tuesday, but analysts expect earnings growth to slow in 1997. The group's combined profit is expected to top C$6 billion ($4.5 billion) for the year ended Oct. 31, eclipsing a record C$5.2 billion ($3.8 billion) in 1995, analysts said. Most of the increase was due to higher investment banking and fee revenues and lower loan losses. ""It's going to be a very good quarter again, but we may be getting toward the end of very strong quarter-over-quarter growth,"" said Roy Palmer, an analyst with TD Securities Inc. High-flying bank stocks may get a further boost if the group beats analysts' estimates for fourth-quarter profit gains of between 15 percent and 17 percent. ""If we get good news and they come in at or higher than analysts' estimates, I think you will see some significant strength,"" said Fred Ketchen, director of equity trading for ScotiaMcLeod Inc. The Toronto Stock Exchange's financial services group jumped 176 points to close at a 52-week high of 5541.40 on Monday as analysts predicted several banks would reward shareholders with dividend hikes. Bank shares have soared this autumn as foreign investors stampeded into Canada's financial markets, lured by declining interest rates, low inflation and a recovering economy. The sector has added about 1,400 points since early September and powered the TSE to record heights. Listings on the New York Stock Exchange have given Canadian banks a higher profile south of the border. Some U.S. brokers have issued buy ratings on Canadian bank stocks, which are considered cheap compared to U.S. issues. But earlier this month, Canadian brokerage CIBC Wood Gundy lowered its recommendations on most of the group. CIBC Wood Gundy analyst Mark Maxwell said the group's valuation multiples were averaging 1.7 times book value -- narrowing the gap between Canadian bank shares and their U.S. counterparts. Maxwell said in a report that bank officials warned analysts that their estimates for average earnings growth of 14 percent in 1997 were too optimistic and that 8 percent was The earnings parade will kick off with Bank of Montreal on Tuesday and wrap up with National Bank of Canada on Dec. 5. Bank of Montreal is expected to post a fourth-quarter profit of C$1.06 (79 cents) a share, up from C$0.93 (69 cents) a share a year ago, according to figures provided by the International Brokerage Estimates Service. Bank of Nova Scotia's earnings on Wednesday are seen climbing to C$1.01 (75 cents) a share from 88 cents Canadian (65 cents) a share. Toronto-Dominion Bank's earnings are forecast to rise to 74 cents Canadian (55 cents) a share on Thursday, up from 72 cents Canadian (54 cents) a share last year. Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce -- the country's two biggest banks -- report next week.

"Bank of Montreal, Canada's third biggest bank, said Tuesday annual profits soared past C$1 billion ($750 million) as it kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings reporting season for the country's largest banks. The Toronto-based bank, which has operations in Canada, the United States and Mexico, said net income jumped 18.4 percent to C$1.17 billion ($873 million) in the year ended Oct. 31. The bank's return on equity, a key measure of profitability, rose to 17 percent from 15.4 percent last year. ""These results represent the seventh consecutive year of record earnings and the seventh consecutive year return on equity was over 14 percent,"" Chairman Matthew Barrett said in a statement. Bank of Montreal is the third bank to break through the C$1 billion threshold in recent years, following the Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. The bank attributed the record earnings to higher fees, volume growth in Canada and the United States and the impact of acquiring a 16 percent stake in Mexico's Grupo Financiero Bancomer SA de CV. About 47 percent of the Bank of Montreal's total income came from operations outside of Canada in fiscal 1996. Net income from its U.S. operations, where the bank owns Chicago-based Harris Bankcorp Inc., rose 6 percent to C$390 million ($291 million). Earnings from Mexico rose 4 percent to C$57 million ($42 million). Other international businesses contributed C$102 million ($76 million) to the bank's bottom line, up 1 percent from 1995. Speaking to reporters, Barrett said the bank should meet or exceed 10 percent growth in annual earnings per share going forward. ""There is sufficient counter cyclicality built into the range of businesses and range of geographies that we're operating in now that we continue to feel that we would be able to maintain that 10 percent EPS growth or better in the years ahead,"" Barrett said. The bank's earnings were generally in line with estimates. Fourth quarter earnings rose to C$1.04 (77 cents) a share from 93 cents (69 cents) in the same period in 1995. ""They were a little weaker than what I was looking for, but pretty much in line for intents and purposes,"" said Kevin Choquette, an analyst with Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc. Choquette had forecast fourth quarter earnings of C$1.06 (79 cents) a share. Improved credit quality also contributed to the bank's strong performance. It's provision for credit losses fell to C$225 million ($168 million) in 1996 from C$275 million ($205 million) in 1995. Barrett told reporters that the bank will plan for a credit loss provision of C$275 million in 1997. ""We'll stick with that until we are six months into the year and see how the credit cycle shakes out,"" he said. Bank of Montreal's stock closed down C$0.45 (33 cents) to C$44.20 (33 cents) in heavy turnover of 1.5 million shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The recent rally in Canadian bank stocks pushed Bank of Montreal's return on investment up 42.4 percent in 1996, compared to a 24-percent gain last year. Despite today's weakness in Bank of Montreal shares, the TSE's banks and trusts index climbed 14 points to a new high of 6164.60. ",DarrenSchuettler
"Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada's fourth largest bank, joined a once exclusive club on Wednesday, reporting its first C$1 billion annual profit. The Toronto-based bank said net income jumped 22 percent to C$1.069 billion in the year ended October 31. It also rewarded shareholders with a C$0.03 increase in its quarterly dividend to C$0.37 a share, its second dividend hike of 1996. ""Scotiabank's financial results exceeded our targets once again in 1996,"" chairman and chief executive Peter Godsoe said in a statement.   Scotiabank was the fourth of Canada's Big Six banks to break the C$1 billion threshold. Bank of Montreal posted a record C$1.17 billion profit on Tuesday when it kicked off the Canadian banking group's year-end reporting season. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce joined the club last year, following Royal Bank of Canada in 1994. Godsoe said all of Scotiabank's main business lines contributed to its record performance, including personal, corporate and investment banking. Improved credit quality also contributed to the bank's bottom line.   Return on equity, a key measure of profitability, rose to 15.8 percent in 1996 from 14.2 percent last year. The bank's fourth-quarter earnings were slightly better than the average of analysts' estimates. Earnings rose to C$1.08 a share in the three months ended October 31 from C$0.88 in the same period in 1995. The consensus forecast from analysts was C$1.05 or C$1.06 a share. ""They are strong and probably surprising,"" one industry analyst said. Other analysts said the results were in line with their expectations.   Susan Cohen, an analyst with Deacon Capital Corp, had forecast C$1.08 per share in the fourth quarter. ""They were right in line,"" Cohen said, adding that the bank's loan losses and the dividend increase were expected. Scotiabank stock rose 0.30 to 46.15 in mid-afternoon turnover of 402,000 shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Among other financial highlights: * Net interest income rose 15 percent to C$3.58 billion in 1996, due mostly to strong growth in earning assets across all business lines. The bank also posted securities gains of C$129 million in 1996, versus gains of C$38 million in 1995.   The cost of funding impaired loans also fell due to lower interest rates and a drop in the level of impaired loans. * Other income jumped 14 percent to C$1.78 billion in 1996. The bank attributed the increase to stronger revenues from electronic and card services and higher loan fees. With financial markets enjoying a prolonged rally in 1996, the bank's full service and discount brokerage operations posted a 50 percent jump in revenues. * Non-interest expenses grew by 13 percent to C$3.22 billion, due mostly to performance related compensation and higher business volumes.   * Net impaired loans fell 49 percent to C$743 million in 1996. Net impaired loans as a percentage of total loans and acceptances improved to 0.7 percent, their lowest since 1989. * Provision for credit losses dropped to C$380 million in 1996, down from C$560 million last year. The bank's general provision remained at C$325 million. -- Reuters Toronto Bureau (416) 941-8100 ",DarrenSchuettler
"Toronto-Dominion Bank extended the run of record Canadian bank profits on Thursday with a 15 percent jump in 1996 earnings and a dividend hike for its shareholders. Canada's fifth largest bank said net income climbed to C$914 million in the year ended October 31 from C$794 million in 1995. Bank of Montreal and Bank of Nova Scotia earlier this week posted record full-year earnings. The strong results prompted TD Bank to boost its quarterly dividend by C$0.03 to C$0.28 a share.   Bank of Nova Scotia raised its dividend by C$0.03 a share to C$0.37 a share on Wednesday. TD Bank said its performance reflected strong growth in other income, with significant gains in investment banking, brokerage and mutual fund businesses. The bank's loan loss provision also sank to its lowest level in more than a decade. ""With a solid financial performance and progress in developing our businesses, TD had a positive impact on the Canadian economy in 1996,"" chairman and chief executive Richard Thomson said in a statement.   Return on equity, a key measure of profitability, rose to 15.4 percent in 1996 from 14.3 percent last year. The bank's fourth-quarter earnings were in line with analysts' estimates. Earnings rose to C$0.79 a share in the fourth quarter ended October 31 from C$0.71 a share in the same period in 1995. The consensus analysts' forecast was for C$0.79 a share in the fourth quarter. ""They were dead on expectations. The dividend increase was also expected,"" said Hugh Brown, an analyst with Nesbitt Burns Inc.   Analysts said the revised loan loss provision was a surprise. The bank cut its 1996 provision to C$152 million from a previous third-quarter estimate of C$170 million and from C$180 million in 1995. Net impaired loans in the fourth quarter fell C$95 million to C$344 million. ""This decline was largely due to improvement in real estate loans to corporate borrowers,"" the bank said. Net impaired loans as a percentage of total loans and acceptances dropped to 0.4 percent at year end. TD stock was up 0.80 to 37.65 on turnover of 821,000 shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

"Canada's Big Six banks are cruising toward a record C$6 billion ($4.4 billion) annual profit with strong earnings from three banks and buoyant profits expected from Canada's two other largest banks next week. Bank of Montreal and Bank of Nova Scotia -- the number three and four banks respectively -- cracked the C$1 billion ($740 million) mark this week. Toronto-Dominion Bank fell short of the billion dollar club, but Canada's fifth largest bank still turned in a record year. The profit parade continues when Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce deliver their results on Wednesday and Thursday respectively. ""They will have whopping earnings. They will be record earnings, rest assured,"" Roy Palmer, a banking analyst with TD Sercurities Inc., said on Friday. National Bank of Canada, the smallest of the Big Six, also reports its earnings next Thursday. Bank of Montreal, Scotiabank and TD posted double-digit increases in net income this week -- with strong growth in personal, corporate and investment banking. The earnings so far have been in line with analysts' forecasts. ""There were no surprises. Just really solid quarters from everybody,"" said CIBC Wood Gundy analyst Mark Maxwell. The banks' investment, brokerage and mutual fund businesses enjoyed a banner year as financial markets soared in 1996. Royal Bank's investment arm. RBC Dominion Securities Ltd, has already posted a record profit. RBC said on Thursday its earnings jumped to C$154.3 million ($114 million) in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, up from C$77 million ($57 million) a year ago. ""In addition to two major mergers...each of our four global businesses turned in strong performances contributing to record results for the year,"" said RBC president Reay Mackay. RBC recently completed its C$480 million ($355 million) purchase of brokerage firm Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd., and merged some operations with parent Royal Bank. CIBC's investment unit is also expected to post bullish earnings when the bank reports its results next week. Analysts said earnings growth for the Big Six is expected slow in 1997, particularly if bond and stock markets cool off. However, TD Bank expects the boom to continue. ""The current low level of interest rates should result in increased economic activity in Canada in 1997 and the gradual return of consumer confidence,"" said TD president Charles Baillie. More dividend hikes are possible next week following increases at Scotiabank and TD. Scotiabank raised its payout by C3 cents (2 cents) to C37 cents (27 cents) a share, its second increase of 1996. TD boosted its dividend by C3 cents (2 cents) to C28 cents (21 cents) a share. ""I would be astonished if CIBC did not increase its dividend at this time,"" said Palmer. CIBC last raised its dividend by C5 cents (4 cents) to C45 cents (33 cents) last June. Maxwell said there is less pressure on Royal Bank and National Bank to raise their dividends now, but an increase may come in early 1997. Improved credit quality also contributed to bottom lines of Scotiabank, Bank of Montreal and TD. All three banks reported lower loan loss provisions for 1996. TD surprising analysts with a deeper-than-expected drop in its provision to C$152 million ($112 million) from C$180 million ($133 million) in 1995. Analysts said loan losses for the Big Six appear to have touched bottom and are expected to creep higher next year. ",DarrenSchuettler
"Royal Bank of Canada, Canada's biggest bank, rolled up a record annual profit Wednesday and surprised shareholders with a dividend hike. The Toronto-based bank said net income jumped to C$1.43 billion ($1.05 billion) in the year ended Oct. 31, up from C$1.26 billion ($931 million) in 1995. Royal Bank also boosted its quarterly dividend by C3 cents (2 cents) to C37 cents (27 cents) a share -- the third increase in the past 15 months. It was the third Canadian bank to raise its dividend in the current earnings reporting season. Royal Bank was the fourth of Canada's Big Six banks to post a third straight year of record profits. Results from Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada, which are due Thursday, were expected to push the group's earnings past the C$6 billion level ($4.4 billion), up from last year's record C$5.2 billion ($3.8 billion). ""We're announcing strong results ... and this dividend increase is evidence of our commitment to rewarding shareholders and enhancing shareholder value,"" Royal Bank Chairman John Cleghorn said in a statement. Higher asset volumes, lower credit losses and strong performances from wealth management and investment banking fattened Royal Bank's bottom line. The bank's brokerage arm, RBC Dominion Securities Ltd., turned in a record year due to strong financial markets. Royal Bank's credit quality also continued to improve. The provision for credit losses fell C$140 million ($103 million) to C$440 million ($325 million) in 1996 and was expected to fall more in 1997. Return on equity, a key measure of profitability, rose 1 percentage point to 17.6 percent in 1996. Royal Bank's fourth-quarter earnings were slightly better than the average of analysts' estimates. Earnings rose to C$1.09 (80 cents) a share in the fourth quarter from C90 cents (66 cents) in the same period in 1995. The consensus forecast from analysts was about C$1.04 (77 cents) a share. Royal Bank's dividend increase surprised some analysts who expected the bank to wait until early next year. The bank is in the middle of a massive share buyback that analysts said had become expensive due to the recent surge in Canadian bank stocks. ""It (the dividend hike) is rather surprising. Maybe they won't be going as far with the buyback and this is compensation,"" said Roy Palmer, a banking analyst with investment dealer TD Securities Inc. Despite the buoyant results, Royal Bank's stock fell along with a sagging Toronto Stock Exchange Wednesday. The bank's shares were off C65 cents (48 cents) at C$48.25 ($35.68) in late trading.

"The Canadian Football League began searching for a new leader on Wednesday after CFL commissioner Larry Smith resigned following a chaotic, money-losing season. Smith, 45, said he will not seek a second term as commissioner when his five-year contract expires on April 1, 1997. ""I am proud to have had the opportunity to work with the CFL, but feel it's time that someone with new ideas and energy be given the opportunity of taking this league into the next millennium,"" Smith said in a statement released by the league. His departure comes as many fans wonder if the embattled league will survive at all. Despite an exciting Grey Cup championship game won by the Toronto Argonauts last month, the CFL is dripping red ink. All but one of its nine clubs lost money this year, due to small crowds and cash bailouts to keep teams in Ottawa, Montreal and Vancouver afloat during the 1996 season. The 120-year-old Ottawa Rough Riders franchise folded last month at the end of the regular season. The future is also cloudy for the Montreal Alouettes -- who won the Grey Cup last year as the Baltimore Stallions, but lured few fans this season. The Vancouver-based British Columbia Lions are also in receivership. Smith, a former running back with the Alouettes, was hired with much fanfare in 1992 after serving as an executive with a Canadian food company. Observers said at the time that the struggling league desperately needed a solid businessman at the helm. But five years later, the league's survival is still in doubt. His most ambitious plan was an ill-fated expansion into the United States which lasted only three seasons. Canadian-style football failed to catch on in cities like Sacramento, San Antonio, Memphis, Las Vegas and Birmingham. Baltimore was the only successful U.S.-based CFL club. It drew decent crowds and became the first American team to win the Grey Cup championship in 1995. But the Stallions were forced to move to Montreal when the National Football League returned to Baltimore this year. Although Smith's expansion dream was sharply criticised by CFL purists, his supporters argued the league would have collapsed without the millions of dollars in expansion fees from U.S. teams. Smith said he will devote the rest of his mandate to implement a cost-cutting plan to save the league. Under the plan, all clubs have until January to secure enough season-ticket sales to operate next year. ",DarrenSchuettler
"Profits at Canada's six big banks topped C$6 billion ($4.4 billion) in 1996, smashing last year's C$5.2 billion ($3.8 billion) record as Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada wrapped up the earnings season on Thursday. The six banks each reported a double-digit jump in net income for a combined profit of C$6.26 billion ($4.6 billion) in fiscal 1996 ended Oct. 31. But a third straight year of record profits came amid growing public anger over perceived high service charges and credit card rates, and tight lending policies. Bank officials defended the group's performance, saying that millions of Canadians owned bank shares through mutual funds and pension plans. Shareholders of four of the six banks were rewarded with healthy dividend hikes this year. ""Our activities mean jobs, investment, tax revenue, dividend payments and foreign income for Canada's economy,"" CIBC chairman Al Flood said after the bank reported a 35 percent jump in net income on Thursday. CIBC, Canada's second-largest bank, said net income climbed to C$1.36 billion ($1 billion) in fiscal 1996 from C$1.01 billion ($743 million) in 1995. CIBC also boosted its quarterly dividend by C5 cents (3.6 cents) to C50 cents (37 cents), the second increase in 1996. Bank of Nova Scotia, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Royal Bank of Canada previously raised their payouts as well. Royal Bank, Canada's largest bank, reported the highest corporate profit in Canadian history on Wednesday, with 1996 net income rising 13 percent to C$1.43 billion ($1.05 billion). Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal cracked the billion-dollar barrier this year, joining CIBC and Royal Bank, which crossed the threshold in 1995 and 1994 respectively. National Bank, the smallest of the big six, posted a 30 percent jump in net income to C$318 million ($234 million) this year. The banks attributed their performances to lower credit losses and healthy commercial and personal banking. Investment banking, brokerage and mutual fund businesses also enjoyed a banner year as financial markets soared in 1996. Earnings at CIBC's Wood Gundy Inc. investment arm skyrocketed 122 percent to C$528 million ($389 million) in 1996. The group's earnings and dividend hikes were in line or slightly better than analysts' forecasts. ""It was good news and a fairly good outlook for 1997 in terms of earnings and dividends,"" said Hugh Brown, a banking analyst with investment dealer Nesbitt Burns Inc. Brown said he now had a more positive outlook for bank earnings in 1997, saying Big Six profits may grow between 9 and 10 percent next year, up from previous growth forecasts of about 7 percent. Bank stocks, which have led the Toronto Stock Exchange to new heights since September, fell on Thursday in tandem with the rest of the market. CIBC led the decline, dropping C$2.50 ($1.84) to close at C$57 ($42) in brisk trading. ",DarrenSchuettler

"Ontario Hydro, North America's biggest power utility, said Tuesday that it would take a huge C$2.5 billion ($1.8 billion) charge in 1996 to strengthen its financial structure. The debt-laden, Ontario government-owned utility said its board of directors also approved a C$600 million ($440 million) charge against 1997 earnings. The charges, related to accounting and operational changes, come as the ruling Conservative government of Canada's most-populous province ponders the privatisation of the massive utility. The heavy writedowns add up to an estimated 1996 net loss of C$1.9 billion ($1.4 billion), Ontario Hydro said in a statement. The utility previously forecast net income of between C$600 million ($440 million) and C$625 million ($460 million). ""These decisions are driven by our determination to improve nuclear performance and to make capital and policy decisions that enable us to succeed in the business environment we face,"" said Ontario Hydro Chief Executive Officer Allan Kupcis. He said the move will not affect Hydro's ability to pay down its debt, estimated at more than C$30 billion ($22 billion) due to overexpansion. Ontario Hydro is the continent's largest electricity producer based on installed generating capacity and one of the world's biggest non-sovereign borrowers. It operates 96 hydro-electric stations, five nuclear plants and six fossil-fuel stations. But competitive pressures from within and outside Ontario have forced changes on Hydro in recent years. Last June, a government commission recommended that Ontario Hydro lose its 90-year power monopoly and face competition from private Canadian power suppliers and U.S.-based competitors. Among the operating decisions made Tuesday, the utility said it will scale back or cancel some projects. The biggest single charge was a C$1.2 billion ($882 million) writedown reflecting the costs of surplus heavy water at its nuclear operations. The decisions will not affect employee staffing levels at the utility. ",DarrenSchuettler
"Three Canadian financial institutions on Tuesday launched North America's first city-wide, reusable ""smart"" card designed to replace cash in retail transactions. The Exact card will be tested under a pilot programme operated by Bank of Montreal, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canada Trust, a unit of CT Financial Services Inc. The project will be in Kingston, Ontario, city of about 100,000 people located 168 miles (270 km) northeast of Toronto. About 600 Kingston merchants -- including convenience stores, gas stations and fast food outlets -- signed up with the test project. The consortium is advertising Exact as an alternative to cash, credit and debit cards. Canadians currently spend between C$40 billion ($29 billion) and C$60 billion ($44 billion) using small coins and bills. ""With Exact you don't have to carry as many small bills and coins, and you'll always have the exact change required to make fast, convenient purchases,"" said Ron Hodge, vice president of card and direct services for TD Bank. Canadians are among the biggest users of plastic cards in the world. They carry an estimated 46.2 million debt and credit cards, while use of these cards has jumped 43 percent in the past year, according to a recent industry survey. ""Technology is rapidly changing the face of money, providing faster, easier and more secure transactions. This is only the beginning,"" said Tim Hockey, vice president of core banking services for Canada Trust. Exact will be followed in early 1997 by a community-wide test of Mondex, a rival ""smart"" card system developed in Britain. Exact is based on smart card technology developed by Belgium-based Banksys. Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce will roll out their Mondex system in Guelph, a city of about 100,000 people 50 miles (80 kms) west of Toronto. Both systems are similar in that they involve storing money on a computer chip embedded within a card. When a customer uses the card to make a purchase, the value is subtracted from the card. Customers simply insert their card in the merchant's special, hand-held purchase terminal. The merchant enters the purchase price and the customer presses the ""OK"" button. The electronic value of the sale is collected in the purchase terminal and transferred via telephone modem to the merchant's bank account at the end of the day. Exact users can load, or electronically transfer cash from bank account to the card, up to C$200 ($147) from terminals in the Kingston branches of Bank of Montreal, TD Bank and Canada Trust. Load terminals will also be located in shopping malls, student campuses and selected stores. The card will initally be offered at no charge. But after an introductory period, each financial institution will set a fee for its own customers. ",DarrenSchuettler
"Canada's cash-strapped public broadcaster, the CBC, cut almost 1,000 jobs on Wednesday in an overhaul that might eventually include on-air fund-raising drives and corporate sponsorships. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. -- faced with a C$414 million ($304 million) reduction in government subsidies -- told 996 employees that they would be laid off. The layoff notices were part of a plan announced in September to scrap 2,400 jobs through layoffs, voluntary departures and the elimination of vacant positions. The CBC also set a target of 800 job cuts in 1998. ""Without doubt, the next few months will be tough. However, we have some sense that on the financial front the worst may be over,"" Jim Byrd, vice-president of CBC English television, said in a letter to employees. The CBC, which provides television and radio services in English and French, previously announced other measures to pare more than a third from its C$1.4 billion ($1.02 billion) budget by 1998. The Canadian government contributed almost two-thirds of the CBC budget in the past, but the government's huge budget deficit forced deep cuts in funding for the CBC. CBC unions said the job cuts would result in an inferior product for Canadian taxpayers. ""There's shock. There's anger. These are people with hundreds of years of experience who will walk out the door and never come back again,"" said Dan Oldfield, a spokesman for the Canadian Media Guild, which represents 3,000 CBC workers. On Monday, the CBC said Radio Canada International -- Canada's voice to the world -- would close next March due to a lack of government funding. To offset shrinking federal subsidies, CBC President Perrin Beatty said earlier this week that the broadcaster may use on-air fund-raising drives and corporate sponsorships. Beatty recently visited the New York-based U.S. public television network PBS, which holds fund-raising campaigns and receives millions of dollars from Canadian viewers. ""It's something that is under discussion as we speak,"" said CBC spoksman Tom Curzon, adding that the CBC board had not made a final decision. To boost revenues and ratings, the CBC relied on popular U.S. television shows and major sporting events in recent years. But some CBC purists complained that the broadcaster had forsaken its mandate to promote and protect Canada's identity from the U.S. cultural behemoth. In September, Beatty said CBC would return to its Canadian roots by eliminating U.S. shows from prime time and day-time schedules by 1998. Canadians will also see more advertisements on the CBC, including commercials for the first time on its flagship evening news show, the National. ",DarrenSchuettler
"Shares in Canadian waste and transportation firm Laidlaw Inc soared on Tuesday as investors and analysts applauded major moves in ambulance services and waste management worth over $2 billion. While Laidlaw's stock hit new heights on the Toronto Stock Exchange, chief executive officer James Bullock said the company is poised for strong growth with two huge deals announced after the market closed on Monday. In a bid to become North America's top ambulance operator, Laidlaw plans to acquire Colorado-based American Medical Response Inc in a $1.12 billion cash deal and merge it with its California-based MedTrans ambulance services unit. In the other transaction, Laidlaw has signed a letter of intent to sell its South Carolina-based Environmental Services unit for $1 billion in cash, shares and debt to Rollins Environmental Services Inc of Delaware. Laidlaw will own 66-percent of a new combined company, Laidlaw Environmental Services Inc., which will be the dominant player in North American hazardous waste management. The moves came a few weeks after Burlington, Ontario-based Laidlaw completed the $1.65 billion sale of its solid waste management business to Allied Waste Industries Inc of Arizona. Laidlaw's class B stock closed up C$1.80 ($1.33) at a 52-week high of C$18 ($13) in heavy turnover of 9.3 million shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Laidlaw's class A stock improved C$1.45 ($1.06) to a new high of C$17.95 ($13.23). ""We've got a (share price) target level of around C$19 ($14) and C$20 ($15) for the year and it will probably go higher when the dust settles,"" said Ira Katzin, an investment advisor with RBC Dominion Securities. AMR jumped 6-3/8 to close at 39-3/8 on the New York exchange, while Rollins Environmental added 1/2 at 2-1/2. Analysts said the Rollins deal will further consolidate a fragmented industry and may improve hazardous waste prices which have been depressed in the past four to five years. The AMR acquisition will also boost Laidlaw's presence in the fast-growing healthcare transportation area. ""Strategically it is quite wise,"" Bunting Warburg Inc. analyst Ted Larkin said in a telephone interview. ""The highest growth potential is with their transportation companies. They are also able to partially spinoff the hazardous waste operations and also allow that company to regain a profile by listing on the New York Stock Exchange,"" Larkin said. In a note to clients, Lehman Brothers analyst Jeff Kessler said the $40 a share offer for AMR is fair and he recommended investors tender their shares. With combined annual revenues of about $1.3 billion, the new AMR will hold a 14 percent share of the $10 billion ambulance industry. It also gives Laidlaw access to related medical transport services which are a $30 billion market. Bullock said AMR will immediately boost Laidlaw's earnings, but he declined to give a specific forecast. Larkin bumped his profit forecast for Laidlaw in the 1997 fiscal year ended August to $0.71 a share from $0.70 per share. He also revised his 1998 forecast up to $0.88 per share from the low eighties. Some analysts raised concerns that anti-trust issues may hamper the AMR deal, but Bullock said he does not foresee any problems with regulators. The transaction with Rollins Environmental will be neutral to Laidlaw's earnings in the near term while operations are consolidated. Bullock said staff levels may be reduced by between 15-20 percent and 20 facilities may be closed, leaving about 100 facilities in the merged firm. The integration will yield more efficient operations and savings of US$75 million annually. ",DarrenSchuettler

"Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Canada's two largest banks, wrapped up the industry's third-quarter profit parade on Thursday with sharply higher earnings. Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest bank, said income climbed 12 percent to C$358 million ($261 million) in the three months ended July 31. CIBC, Canada's second largest bank, reported a 24 percent jump in income to C$336 million ($245 million). CIBC's earnings per share of C$1.50 ($1.09) beat analysts' forecasts of around C$1.43 ($1.04) a share. Royal Bank reported a C$1.02 ($0.74) per share profit, in line with analysts' expectations. The results capped a strong quarter for the six major banks and put them on track for a third straight year of record annual profits. The group rang up a combined profit of C$5.17 billion ($3.7 billion) in the fiscal year ended Oct. 31. Soaring bank profits have sparked hostility from Canadian consumers who complain about high service fees and tight lending policies. In a bid to soften that criticism, the banks have taken to highlighting their tax bills and job creation efforts. For example, CIBC said it paid out more than C$0.50 ($0.36) in taxes for every dollar earned so far this year. The group's public relations efforts may get easier next year when analysts predict earnings growth will start to tail off. In the third quarter, CIBC and Royal Bank gained from stronger loan volumes, higher brokerage and fee revenues and improving credit quality. ""Our solid performance this quarter reflects the continued strong contribution from our core businesses,"" CIBC chairman and chief executive officer Al Flood said in a statement. The bank's return on equity, a key measure of profitability, was 16.6 percent in the third quarter, up from 13.7 in the same quarter last year. Flood said CIBC's personal and commercial bank continued its strong performance this year. Recent strategic moves at CIBC's brokerage unit, CIBC Wood Gundy, are also paying off wth new financial products and high-yield debt adding to the bank's bottom line. Stronger revenues from underwriting, capital markets and foreign exchange pushed non-interest income up 17 percent to C$691 million ($504 million) in the third quarter. Net interest income was up slightly to C$1.1 billion ($800 million) in the third quarter. At Royal Bank, higher revenues from capital market, mutual fund and trading businesses pushed other income up 13 percent to C$757 million ($552 million). Net interest income climbed three percent to C$1.1 billion ($800 million), due mostly to higher asset volumes, lower impaired loans and proceeds from the sale of bonds. ""This quarter was marked by higher growth in residential mortgages and other loans, continued improvement in credit quality and stronger performances from a number of fee-based businesses,"" said Royal Bank chairman John Cleghorn. Royal Bank's return on equity was 17.2 percent compared to 16.4 percent in the third quarter of 1995. Despite the strong performance, shares in both banks finished weaker on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce fell C$0.30 ($0.22) to C$45.15 ($32.80), while Royal Bank lost C$0.20 ($0.14) to close at C$34.20 ($25). ",DarrenSchuettler
"A furry hedgehog, idyllic sunsets and the meaner streets of Budapest seem unlikely moneyspinners, but such images are crowding Canada's airwaves as the annual mutual fund season kicks into gear. Armed with high-powered ad campaigns, eager fund sellers are vying for the billions of dollars Canadians will pour into registered retirement savings plans (RRSPs). With interest rates at 40-year lows and stocks at stratospheric heights, investors are expected to shun interest-bearing investments for higher yielding mutual funds before the March 1 deadline for RRSP contributions. ""We're in the thick of it right now and it's going to get busier and busier toward the end of the (RRSP) season,"" said John Wiltshire, vice-president of marketing for Investors Group, Canada's top fund company with C$25 billion ($18 billion) in assets. TAX BENEFIT IS A DRAW Canada introduced RRSPs in the late 1950s to allow people without registered pension plans to save for retirement. Investors can deduct the amount from their taxes for the previous year's income. Besides being a tax benefit, RRSPs have become more popular as traditional pension benefits are scaled back. Canadians have more than C$211 billion ($156 billion) stashed in mutual funds, an eight-fold increase from 1990. An estimated C$23 billion ($17 billion) will be added to the pot this year. Fund companies also expect a big chunk of the C$250 billion ($186 billion) currently invested in guaranteed investment certificates and term deposits to shift into funds. In what has become an annual rite of the Canadian winter, fund sellers flood the airwaves with promotions, hype and gimmicks to lure RRSP dollars. But, unlike the United States, Canadian broadcast rules prohibit companies from making performance claims on television or radio. ""That's why you get fuzzy advertising. They talk about lifestyle and emphasise branding,"" said John Kaszel, director of research for Investment Funds Institute of Canada, a lobby group representing 40 fund companies. Soft-sell ads feature happy people in tranquil settings with simple messages such as ""We're here to get you there,"" or ""quietly creating wealth."" NEXT GENERATION THE TARGET Some firms are targeting the next generation of investors. GT Global, a member of Liechtenstein Global Trust, launched a Kid's Kit in December to teach youngsters about mutual funds. When a parent opens a minimum C$500 ($370) account, his child gets a stuffed ""Henry the Hedgehog"" toy, a certificate and a colourful book explaining ""Henry's Mysterious Gift."" ""This is a chance to give a gift to your kids that is tangible and gets them into the habit of investing,"" said CT Global President Joe Canavan. Other ads feature smartly tailored people using words such as ""discipline"" and ""performance"" to trumpet their firm's investment strategy. Spectrum United Mutual Funds' gritty commercials highlight its team of tough global fund managers, including one who scored a big success investing in a Budapest security company. To add levity to the RRSP season, Bank of Montreal's campaign pricked the balloons of so-called ""experts"", but there was little information on the bank's own funds. Critics complain that Canada's advertising rules insult investors' intelligence. ""Mutual fund regulators are convinced that mutual fund investors are ignorant dolts who need to be protected from themselves and the industry. The result, as far as radio and television are concerned, is a multimillion dollar river of non-information,"" Toronto Globe and Mail columnist Terence Corcoran wrote recently. SCANDALS MAY MEAN TIGHTER CONTROLS But regulators are unlikely to relax their grip on the industry. In fact, the rules could tighten after recent scandals such as the Veronika Hirsch affair. Hirsch was a star stock picker hired last summer to spearhead Boston-based Fidelity Investments' drive to dominate the Canadian market. But she was removed from her portfolio in November amid a controversy over personal trades she made before joining the world's biggest mutual fund company. Fidelity also offered clients their money back without penalty. ""We were pleased that the number of people who did take advantage of it was less than our expectation,"" said spokesman Chethan Lakshman, but he did not give any numbers. Hirsch's True North Equity Fund is now under a less flamboyant manager and has accumulated C$211 million ($156 million) in assets since its launch last September. Hirsch's status was under discussion, Lakshman said, but a separation package was rumoured to be under negotiation. FALLOUT PROMPTS GUIDELINES REVIEW The fallout from the Hirsch affair prompted a review of the industry's guidlines for fund managers. ""It has opened up some concerns, but those are being addressed. Now we are seeing whether more should be done,"" Kaszel said. While analysts said it was difficult to assess the damage to the industry's credibility, the Hirsch affair changed how companies sell their product. Brash campaigns built around high-profile stock pickers are out and the ""team"" is in, analysts said. Canada's Big Six banks are also heavy advertisers this year as they strive to become bigger players in a industry dominated by independents. Three banks are now among the top 10 firms, with Royal Bank of Canada number three behind Investors Group amd Trimark Investment Management Inc. The banks were allowed to enter the mutual fund business in 1987 and now account for 29 percent of the industry's assets. Fund management fees have helped propel bank profits to record highs in recent years. ",DarrenSchuettler
"Veronika Hirsch, a flamboyant Canadian stock picker whose high-profile move to Fidelity Investments was marred by controversy, parted with the Boston-based fund company on Tuesday. ""We've concluded the discussions and Fidelity wishes Ms. Hirsch well in her future endeavours,"" Fidelity spokesman Chethan Lakshman said in a telephone interview. Hirsch was a star fund manager hired last summer to spearhead Fidelity's drive to dominate the Canadian market. But Canada's so-called ""Fund Diva"" was removed from her portfolio in November amid a controversy over personal trades she made before joining the world's biggest mutual fund company. Lakshman did not give details of the agreement with Hirsch, who has kept a low profile since her investments in a small Vancouver company, Oliver Gold Corp., grabbed headlines and the attention of regulators last November. Hirsch's lawyer, Tom Lockwood, said on Tuesday that she is weighing her options, including offers to go on the lecture circuit or write a book. ""There's private money management prospects and there are mutual fund prospects. There have been a number of approaches made and she's considering what she will do next,"" he said. At issue was Hirsch's purchase of 65,000 special warrants of Oliver Gold through a private placement while she was a fund manager with AGF Management Ltd. in Toronto. Shortly after the warrant purchase, Hirsch's AGF Growth &amp; Income Fund bought 295,000 special warrants of Oliver Gold at more than double the price paid by Hirsch, according to filings with the British Columbia Securities Commission and reported by Stockwatch, a Canadian investment publication. Fidelity removed Hirsch from her True North Equity Fund last November after Canadian securities regulators confirmed her personal investments were under investigation. The dramatic move came barely three months after Fidelity poached Hirsch from AGF to lead its expansion drive in Canada where it ranks ninth with C$8.2 billion ($6.1 billion) in assets. Canadians have more than C$211 billion ($156 billion) stashed in mutual funds, an eight-fold increase from 1990. An estimated C$23 billion ($17 billion) will be added to the pot this year, analysts forecast. While at AGF, Hirch was the focus of a multi-million dollar advertising campaign which made her Canada's top celebrity fund manager. When Hirsch jumped to Fidelity, her leather outfits and blood-red nails appeared an uncomfortable fit with Fidelity's ultra-conservative culture, but the hiring was considered a major coup within the industry. Hirsch's old True North fund is now under a less flamboyant manager and has accumulated C$280 million ($208 million) in assets since its launch last September. While analysts have said it is difficult to assess the damage to Fidelity's expansion drive, the Hirsch affair has changed how fund companies sell their product. Brash campaigns built around high-profile stock pickers are out and the ""team"" is in, analysts said. ",DarrenSchuettler
"Shivering icewine enthusiasts, battered by icy winds, headed into a snow-covered vineyard on a recent night to harvest one of the world's rarest wines. Although Germany discovered the luscious dessert wine in the late 18th century, Canada is the world's largest producer of icewine -- capturing many international awards and helping shed an industry reputation for screw-top plonk that neither amuses nor has any pretentions. If you can find it, this ""liquid gold"" can cost up to C$200 ($150) a bottle in icewine-crazy Japan -- four times the price in Canada. Japan is by far the biggest export market, but China and South Korea are also developing a taste for it. But on this cold winter night a cup of piping hot coffee could fetch a better price than any chilled wine. ""It's cold, hard work. You're outside in the dark picking frozen grapes and wondering why you're not asleep like normal people,"" Greg Berti, general manager of Hillebrand Estates Winery, said on a recent midnight tour of Hillebrand's icewine fields. Most of the Canadian vintage comes from the Niagara wine region where 24 wineries produced 29,700 gallons (112,500 liters) in 1995. That is up 57 percent from 1994 but paltry compared to the eight million gallons (30 million liters) of regular wine produced yearly in Ontario, Canada's most populous province. Some California wineries produce sweet wines but they are shunned by icewine purists because the grapes are artificially frozen. ""Their wine is interesting, but it's not in the same league as icewine,"" Berti said. IT MAY BE RARE BUT IT TASTES LIKE PEACHES Although Niagara wineries say their products are unique in taste, icewine is generally amber or golden in colour with a full-flavored taste similar to honey, apricots or peaches. It is thicker than regular wine, with an alcohol content of about 10 percent, compared to 40 percent for a cognac or brandy. Canada exports icewine to Germany, Denmark, Hong Kong, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States. China and Korea are also emerging markets. But the biggest buyers are Japanese tourists who flock to the Niagara region by the busload -- snapping up several bottles of icewine after a visit to nearby Niagara Falls. Hillebrand sells about 75 percent of its icewine to Japanese who tour its winery. ""Their image of Canada is Banff, Anne of Green Gables and Niagara Falls, and icewine fits in with that image,"" Berti said. Last summer, a group of 74 Japanese race horse owners descended on another Niagara winery and drove off with more than $10,000 worth of icewine. ""They came into the winery, sampled, bought and were back in their bus in 45 minutes,"" recalled Debi Pratt, director of public relations for Inniskillin Wines Inc. ALMOST AS HARD TO PRODUCE AS GOLD It takes every grape from an entire vine to yield enough juice to make one bottle of icewine -- 10 times the amount used to make regular wines. Many grapes are lost to hungry birds, hail or harsh winter winds before they are picked. But Canada has plenty of what is needed most to make icewine -- consistently cold weather. The grapes -- hardy Vidal or Riesling varieties -- must be picked off the vine when temperatures are well below freezing. Most wineries set aside part of their vineyards in October when the regular wine harvest ends. By mid-December or early January the shriveled grapes have turned a brownish hue and pickers are on call, waiting for the right weather. Berti said Mother Nature has sometimes forced crews to pick on Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve -- although that did not happen this year. ""The wind is the biggest problem. Every hour or half hour we take a break for hot coffee and donuts,"" Gregory Synos, a six-year veteran of the icewine harvest, said. The grapes are sorted and rushed to the winery where presses work into the night. The juice then goes through several weeks of fermentation, followed by a few months of ageing in oak barrels to smooth out the acidity and tanins in immature icewine. Although Hillebrand has tried to modernise the process by using special presses and protective netting for the grapes, Berti conceded: ""There is nothing efficent about it. You have to get into the fields when the getting is good."" ",DarrenSchuettler
"Ontario Finance Minister Ernie Eves, buoyed by a stronger economy and an improving deficit outlook, said on Thursday his budget-paring knife would not cut as deep this year. ""I would say that the majority of the cost-cutting exercise this government has to do is behind us,"" Eves told reporters after delivering a fiscal update for the third quarter ended December 31. Ontario's 1996/97 deficit is now pegged at C$7.67 billion for the year ending March 31, down C$508 million from Eves' original budget forecast. Ontario is Canada's most populous province and industrial powerhouse. Barely four months ago, Ontario's ruling Conservatives said a further C$3 billion in spending cuts would be needed to balance the budget by the turn of the century. Since sweeping to power in 1995 promising a ""Common Sense Revolution"", the Conservatives have identified about C$8 billion in cuts through the end of the decade. With the economy now improving, Eves said: ""I don't feel that I am now driven to find C$3 billion in more savings."" Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce has predicted Ontario's economy would pick up steam this year despite government cutbacks. The economy was forecast to grow 3.1 percent this year and 2.3 percent in 1998, compared to 1.7 percent in 1996. But Eves said the province's deficit fight was far from over and he was still seeking ""cost efficiencies"" for the upcoming 1997/98 budget this spring. ""I don't want anybody to think we don't have a problem. We still have a C$7.7 billion problem on annualized basis in the province of Ontario,"" he said. Government revenues grew faster than projected in the third quarter, up almost C$1.2 billion to C$47.8 billion for the year. Most of the increase was due to higher than expected personal, corporate and retail sales tax revenues resulting from a stronger economy, Eves said. He said the government's controversial 30 percent tax cut had helped boost consumer confidence in Ontario. About half of the tax reduction has been implemented, with the remaining 15 percent due by 1999. Eves said he had not ruled out speeding up that timetable, but that the government had a lot on its plate. Last month, the Conservatives unveiled sweeping reforms that would fundamentally alter the roles of provincial and local governments in everything from health care and social spending to road maintenance and sewage. The most controversial move is a proposed merger of Toronto, Canada's biggest city, and five surrounding municipalities, which has drawn fierce opposition from some local politicians and businesses. CIBC said the provincial government would better its fiscal targets after downloading services such as welfare and transit to municipalities. Toronto is a potential loser under the plan because it has a large share of the province's welfare cases. Eves said the government would push forward with its plans and on Thursday he doubled the government's restructuring fund to C$1.8 billion. ""I think people realize we can't operate in 1997 the way we operated in 1957 in the province of Ontario. There is a transition and that transition costs money,"" he said. ",DarrenSchuettler
"Canada unveiled plans on Friday to lift restrictions on foreign banks in a bid to spur competition in a sector dominated by six big domestic banks. Draft legislation allowing foreign banks to open branches in Canada will be ready before the end of 1997. But a possible federal election may delay the passage of the bill in Canada's parliament until next year, said Doug Peters, secretary of state for financial institutions. ""Branching will encourage new banks to enter the Canadian marketplace and allow existing foreign banks greater opportunity to compete,"" Peters said in a statement. He told reporters that the government needed time to develop branching rules, including a tax regime. Foreign bankers have complained that Canada lagged behind its Group of Seven trading partners in opening up its banking sector to foreign competition. Current rules require foreign banks to operate separately capitalized subsidiaries in Canada. The higher cost of operating a subsidiary, rather than a branch, has driven several foreign banks out of the country. Last year a federal ""white paper"" on financial reforms introduced only minor changes to foreign bank rules, but parliament subsequently issued reports urging freer access to Canada's markets for foreign banks. The number of foreign banks operating in Canada has dropped to 43 from a peak of about 60 in the 1980s. The legislation has not been written yet, but a freer market would make Canada more attractive, said Alfred Buhler, chairman of Bank of America Canada, a unit of BankAmerica Corp. ""It will slow the erosion and may reverse that trend. I think a number of banks who are not currently operating in Canada will take another hard look,"" Buhler said. Canada's big six domestic banks already dominate regular banking, trusts and brokerages. But they are being challenged by the Internet and the rise of new ""virtual banks."" Dutch financial services giant ING Groep N.V. is set to launch a telephone banking operation in Canada early next year and has earmarked an initial investment of $50 million for direct marketing of a range of savings and loans products. Citicorp and Wells Fargo and Co. are also planning banking services aimed at Canadian consumers and small businesses. Canadian bankers have said they would welcome more foreign competition as long as it is on a level playing field. ""We have absolutely no concerns about being able to compete successfully. There is a need to ensure that regulations -- tax, capital adequacy, corporate governance policies and so on -- are reasonably balanced,"" Bank of Nova Scotia chairman Peter Godsoe said recently. Canadian bankers complained that their foreign rivals did not pay the same capital taxes in Canada as domestic banks. They also argued that virtual banks would not create new jobs in Canada, although critics noted that Canadian banks had shed staff recently in a move to electronic banking services. Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest bank with more than $150 billion in assets, supports granting more access to foreign banks if rules barring Canadian banks from getting bigger are lifted. Royal Bank and its counterparts have seen their international rankings slip sharply in recent years. They argue domestic bank mergers may be necessary if Canada is to remain competitive internationally. Federal laws discourage bank mergers by limiting investors to a minimum 10 percent stake in a Canadian bank. A government task force plans to study these and other competition issues this year.

"Canada's major banks, still smarting from last year's bank-bashing budget, are hoping for no major surprises and perhaps some tax relief from Finance Minister Paul Martin next week. Last year, Martin stunned the banks when he rejected their bid for expanded powers in insurance. He also extended a controversial capital tax on the banks for another year. In the run up to next Tuesday's 1997/98 budget, bankers have lobbied for a lighter tax burden which, they argue, is among the heaviest in corporate Canada. ""We feel the banks are paying more than their fair share of taxes. Particularly our concern is capital taxes,"" said Mark Weseluck, vice-president of banking operations for the Canadian Bankers Association. The Big Six banks -- Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, Toronto-Dominion Bank and National Bank of Canada -- have rung up record profits in the past three years. The group earned a combined C$6.26 billion in 1996, up 21 percent from the previous year. The banks are expected to report strong first-quarter results later this month. At their annual meetings this year, bankers stressed they paid record taxes of more than C$5.5 billion in 1996. But social activists argue the banks should pay more tax on what they call ""excessive"" profits. In its ""alternative"" budget released this week, the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives urged Martin to impose an ""excess profits"" tax on the banks and other financial institutions totaling C$496 million in 1997/98. Other groups want Martin to use the existing 12 percent capital tax to encourage small business lending -- an area in which the banks have been criticized for not doing enough. In Ontario -- where five of the six major banks are based -- the Conservative government hit the banks with a 10 percent capital tax surcharge in last spring's budget. The banks can eliminate some or all of the tax if they invest more in small business between now and the end of 1999. Ontario Finance officials said it was too early to measure the program's performance, but several major banks unveiled small business loan programs in recent months. Weseluck said the Ontario tax had little to do with those announcements. ""The problem when you do this is that taxation gets less efficient the more they are used to boost investment in a certain part of the market which the banks are doing extensively anyway,"" he said. Analysts doubted Martin would do any major tinkering on bank taxes next week. ""I don't expect any new additional taxes and I doubt if there is any tax relief. The only possible source of tax relief is that the government would not extend this capital tax,"" said Nesbitt Burns analyst Hugh Brown. With bank bashing a popular sport among Canadian voters, Martin may be loathe to give the banks a tax break in what is shaping up to be an election year, analysts said. Adding to this year's budget boredom is the absence of last year's noisy battle between the banks and insurers. Martin shocked the banks when he slammed the door on their bid for broader insurance powers and pre-empted a government white paper on financial reforms, which was several months away from being released. Martin has set up a task force to study those and other competition issues, including whether major banks should be allowed to merge. But reforms recommended by the task force are not expected to take effect until 2000. ((Reuters Toronto Bureau 416-941-8100)) ",DarrenSchuettler
"Canada's financial markets gave an approving nod to Finance Minister Paul Martin's stay-the-course 1997/98 budget on Tuesday, with some analysts expecting a modest rally on Wednesday. In what is expected to be an election year, the Liberal government said it will maintain pressure on the deficit while offering minor tax cuts and new spending. Economists said Martin's assumptions on interest rates and economic growth were prudent and should enable the government to beat its fiscal targets. ""What you're going to see tomorrow? A flow of funds into the Canadian dollar briefly, quite possibly the bond market, quite possibly the stock market,"" said Bob Boaz, director of research for HSBC James Capel Canada Inc. But analysts predicted the markets would settle down quickly as most of the budget details were widely expected. ""There was no big news in this budget. But he (Martin) didn't relax his fiscal resolve and that will be well received by the markets,"" said John Anania, an economist at Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest bank. The budget had little immediate impact on the Canadian dollar, but currency traders said they expect the unit to strengthen overnight on Martin's favorable deficit targets. Martin predicted the deficit for 1996/97 would be no more that C$19 billion, compared to a projected C$24.3 billion. The deficit is seen falling to C$17 billion in 1997/98. In early evening trading, the Canadian dollar firmed slightly to C$1.3534 (US$0.7388) from closing levels at C$1.3546 (US$0.7382). ""We expect the Canadian dollar to appreciate overnight as a result of the positive budget,"" said John Nicholson, managing director of Scotia Capital Markets. Canadian bonds strengthened shortly after the budget's release as the market welcomed news of only modest new spending initatives. Some bond analysts expressed concern that Martin did not set a target for balancing the country's books, but overall they expected a neutral reaction to the budget on Wednesday. ""He's made some extremely conservative assumptions, we believe, with interest rates and growth that lead us to conclude he will continue to outperform his own targets,"" said Hank Cunningham, director of fixed income with First Marathon Securities. The budget is expected to be well received on Canada's biggest stock market on Wednesday, after the Toronto Stock Exchange enjoyed record gains on Tuesday, analysts said. Before the budget's release, the TSE's key 300 index posted its ninth record close of 1997, up 20 points to 6238.22. Trading was heavy with turnover of 138.4 million shares worth C$2.52 billion, the TSE's second highest value ever. Martin did not impose new corporate, personal or excise tax increases, but the government did extend a special capital tax on Canada's big banks for another year. ",DarrenSchuettler
"Strong demand for light trucks and relatively few production headaches will boost the Big Three U.S. automakers' combined profits to nearly $2 billion for the third quarter, exceeding year-ago results by a healthy margin, analysts said Tuesday. The quarter is traditionally the weakest of the year with summer vacations and model changeovers, but Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co., are expected to post strong gains from minivan and truck output. General Motors Corp.'s earnings were held back by a significant increase in incentives, analysts said. In the third quarter of 1995, the three automakers earned $1.35 billion. ""It'll be a good quarter overall for the Big Three,"" said Dean Witter Reynolds Inc auto analyst Kenneth Blaschke. ""The issue that remains is how long the strike in Canada against GM will last."" GM, the nation's largest automaker, on Oct. 15 is expected to report third quarter net income of about $850 million, or $1.02 a share, according to the First Call financial information service. The results include an after-tax gain of $250 million, or 33 cents a share from the reversal of the automaker's decision to close its Wilmington, Del., plant and build a new Saturn model there at the end of the decade. In the year-ago period, GM earned $642 million, or 42 cents a share. The third quarter 1995 results also included $246 million in earnings from Electronic Data Systems Corp., the computer services unit that the automaker spun off in June after 12 years of ownership. Burnham Securities auto analyst David Healy said GM's worldwide car and truck production rose 11 percent in the third quarter over a year ago. But a heavier mix of less-expensive vehicles and a $230 increase in incentives per vehicle squeezed GM's profit margins, resulting in a small pretax loss in North America during the period. On an operating basis, Ford's third quarter profits, are expected to increase 78 percent to $637 million, or 51 cents a share, from $357 million, or 28 cents, a year earlier, marking the biggest rebound of the Big Three. Ford results are scheduled for release on Oct. 16. The strength at Detroit's No. 2 automaker largely rides on the fact that it is not paying the enormous product launch costs for the Taurus sedan and F-Series pickup truck that dragged down year-ago results. Ford also is beginning to reap profits from the F-Series, and the Expedition full-size sport utility vehicle, which have brightened the automaker's future outlook. ""We think Ford's new products will enable it to gain an increased share going forward, and as a result Ford's earnings momentum should continue,"" Blaschke said. Ford's profits would be even better had it not been for losses in Brazil and Argentina that the automaker warned analysts about in September. Ford is scambling to put its Fiesta small car into production in Brazil following the breakup of the company's Autolatina joint venture with Volkswagen AG in 1995. Chrysler's profits for the July-September period, scheduled for release Oct. 14, are expected to increase 41 percent to about $500 million, or 69 cents a share, from $354 million, or 48 cents, a year earlier. No. 3 Chrysler also experienced launch problems in the year-ago period in its all-important minivan product lines. This year, the company is churning out minivans and has raised its share of the U.S. vehicle market to record levels. The launch glitches have not returned, as the company's new Dodge Dakota compact pickup truck is proceeding ahead of schedule, analysts said. ""Chrysler has everthing going for it right now and it should be reflected in the earnings,"" said Bear Stearns &amp; Co. auto analyst Nicholas Lobocarro, who added that he would not be surprised if Chrysler's results exceeded Wall Street estimates.

"General Motors Corp. may face mounting losses as the strike against its Canadian operations heads for a second week, but GM Chairman Jack Smith Wednesday vowed not give up his quest for competitiveness. The last of 26,000 Canadian Auto Workers members are set to strike GM plants at midnight Wednesday, bringing the automaker closer to parts shortages and assembly plant shutdowns in the United States. The strike will inevitably affect GM's U.S. plants, but they can ""run for a while"" before a shutdown, said G. Richard Wagoner, president of GM's North American Operations. But Smith, who met with reporters at GM's Technical Center to receive a new J.D. Power and Associates award, said some of the union's demands on outsourcing -- the shifting of work to outside, often non-union companies -- are unacceptable. ""We've got certain things that will cripple the company if we don't get fixed right,"" Smith said. ""There's a couple (items) on the table that we need to work our way through, otherwise we will not be competitive."" He said GM, the least efficient U.S. automaker, needs to sell certain parts plants, despite the CAW's objections, because their wage structures are too high for GM to compete effectively. Smith also said GM was in a strong financial position to handle the strike, with $13 billion in cash, and a fully funded pension plan. Adding to its wherewithal, GM also on Wednesday filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that would allow it to sell up to $1.3 billion in debt securities. Despite the labor strife, Smith credited both U.S. and Canadian workers for helping GM win J.D. Power's first-ever Chairman's Award, which recognizes its gains in quality and customer satisfaction. Smith also said GM continued to have a ""constructive dialogue"" with the United Auto Workers hoped to reach a labor agreement coviering 215,000 U.S. hourly workers soon. Although GM so far has been able to avoid major U.S. shutdowns from the Canadian strike, analysts said the first casualties may be the company's Cadillac luxury car plant in Hamtramck, Mich., which uses trim components made at a Windsor, Ontario, plant set to go on strike Wednesday. GM's small and mid-size car plants in Lansing, Mich., Lordstown, Ohio, and Oklahoma City, Okla., also are in danger of shutdowns, because they use transmissions from another Windsor plant to be struck Wednesday. The Oklahoma City plant is in the midst of launching two important new mid-size sedans, the 1997 Chevrolet Malibu and Oldsmobile Cutlass. The cars, slightly smaller than the Ford Taurus and expected to be priced in the $15,000-$17,000 range, could help GM regain a sizeable piece of the mid-size car market, a segment it once dominated. GM also is launching an all-new Pontiac Grand Prix sedan and a trio of new minivans that are viewed as the automaker's first serious challenge to Chrysler Corp.'s dominance of the segment. Analysts said the Canadian strike, if it continues, will wreak havoc on the production and marketing launches of the products and hand market share gains to Chrysler, Ford Motor Co. and import manufacturers. The only new car to reach dealers in significant volume has been the Grand Prix. ""There was some very strong opportunity for them to gain share with some of the new vehicles,"" said Wesley Brown, an analyst with CSM Forecasting, an automotive consulting firm in Farmington Hills, Mich. ""This will push back their launches."" Dean Witter auto analyst Kenneth Blaschke estimates that a three-week Canadian strike will cost GM about $700 million in profits. A 17-day strike at two Dayton, Ohio, parts plants in March reduced the automaker's first quarter profits by $900 million. But Wall Street analysts maintain the costs, both in profits and lost market share, are worth it if GM can retain the right to shift parts work to outside suppliers and sell unprofitable plants.

"With the strike against General Motors in Canada headed for a second week, the automaker's losses will start mounting as its U.S. plants are forced to shut down, delaying the launch of important new models, analysts said Wednesday. The walkout by the Canadian Auto Workers union is set to spread to two key components plants in Windsor, Ontario, Wednesday at midnight, which could cause the first shutdowns of GM's U.S. assembly plants by early next week. Much of GM's core North American automotive business could be crippled in about two weeks if the strike is not resolved. ""Once you start shutting assembly plants, the other plants start shutting very quickly,"" said Wesley Brown, an analyst at CSM Forecasting, an automotive consulting firm in Farmington Hills, Mich.

He also noted that with $13 billion in cash reserves, virtually no debt and a fully funded pension plan, GM is in a strong position to take a longer strike. ""They aren't the financial cripple they were in 1993,"" he said.

"Strong demand for light trucks and relatively few production headaches boosted the combined profits of the Big Three U.S. automakers to nearly $2 billion in the third quarter, exceeding year-ago results by a healthy margin, analysts said. The third quarter is traditionally the industry's weakest, with summer vacations and model changeovers, but strong minivan and truck output helped buoy profits at Chrysler Corp and Ford Motor Co, they said.   General Motors Corp operating earnings were held back by a significant increase in U.S. incentives, analysts said. In the third quarter of 1995 the three automakers earned a combined total of $1.35 billion. ""It'll be a good quarter overall for the Big Three,"" said Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Kenneth Blaschke. ""The issue that remains is how long the strike in Canada against GM will last."" GM is expected to report third quarter net income of about $850 million, or $1.02 a share, according to First Call.   The results will include an after-tax gain of $250 million, or $0.33 a share, from the reversal of GM's decision to close its Wilmington, Del., plant and build a new Saturn model there at the end of the decade. In the year-ago third quarter GM earned $642 million, or $0.42 a share, including $246 million in earnings from Electronic Data Systems Corp, the computer services unit spun off by GM in June. Burnham Securities analyst David Healy said GM's worldwide car and truck production rose 11 percent in the third quarter over a year ago.   But a heavier mix of less-expensive vehicles and a $230 increase in incentives per vehicle squeezed GM profit margins, which likely resulted in a small pretax loss in North America during the period, he said. GM is to report third quarter results on October 15. On an operating basis, Ford's third quarter profits are expected to increase 78 percent, to $637 million, or $0.51 a share, from $357 million, or $0.28, a year earlier, marking the biggest rebound of the Big Three. Ford results are due October 16.   The strength at Ford largely rides on the fact that it is not paying the enormous product launch costs for the Taurus sedan and F-Series pickup truck that dragged down year-ago results. Ford also is beginning to reap profits from the F-Series and the Expedition full-size sport utility vehicle, which have brightened the automaker's outlook. ""We think Ford's new products will enable it to gain an increased share going forward, and as a result Ford's earnings momentum should continue,"" Blaschke said.   Ford's profits would have been even better but for losses in Brazil and Argentina that the automaker warned about in September. Ford is scambling to put its Fiesta small car into production in Brazil following the breakup of the company's Autolatina joint venture with Volkswagen AG in 1995. Chrysler's third quarter profits, scheduled for release October 14, are expected to increase 41 percent, to about $500 million, or $0.69 a share, from $354 million, or $0.48, a year earlier. Chrysler also experienced launch problems in the year-ago period in its all-important minivan product lines. This year, it is churning out minivans and Dodge Ram pickup trucks and has raised its share of the U.S. vehicle market to record levels. The launch glitches have not returned, and the company's new Dodge Dakota compact pickup truck is proceeding ahead of schedule, analysts said. ""Chrysler has everthing going for it right now and it should be reflected in the earnings,"" said Bear Stearns &amp; Co analyst Nicholas Lobocarro. He said he would not be surprised if the automaker's results exceeded Wall Street estimates. ",DavidLawder
"Ford Motor Co. is in talks with the Detroit Lions on a multi-million dollar deal to purchase naming rights to the football team's proposed new stadium in downtown Detroit, Ford Chairman Alex Trotman said Thursday. The deal, expected to be signed in the next few days, comes as little surprise, since the Lions are owned by Ford board members William Clay Ford and his son, William Clay Ford Jr. Trotman, speaking to reporters following a Ford board of directors meeting at the automaker's Dearborn, Mich., headquarters, said reports that Ford would pay $30 million to $40 million for the rights ""aren't far off"" from the deal Ford is discussing with the National Football League team. Trotman said the company wants to have exclusive rights with the Ford name prominently featured on the domed structure, but has not yet decided on a specific name. ""It would be big-time Ford something -- we don't know what -- either Ford Stadium or Ford Dome,"" Trotman said. William Clay Ford Jr., who holds the Ford board's purse strings as chairman of its finance committee, abstained from board discussions of the project, as did his father. The new stadium project is largely viewed as the younger Ford's brainchild. A contribution of $30 million to $40 million would help the $225 million domed stadium meet a major financing hurdle -- the Lions face a Nov. 1 deadline to gain committments for $50 million in corporate and private contributions. The proposed 65,000-seat football stadium would be built near the end of the decade next to a new $240 million, open-air ballpark for the Detroit Tigers on the edge of downtown Detroit that would seat about 45,000 people. The Lions would leave the Pontiac Silverdome in suburban Pontiac, Mich., where they have played for the past 21 years, but have pledged to honour terms of their current lease, which expires in 2004. The 80,000-seat Silverdome, opened in 1975 at a city-financed cost of $50 million, would become the youngest major league sports facility in the United States to be replaced with a new venue.

"The president of the Canadian Auto Workers held out little hope on Friday for a quick end to a 10-day-old strike against General Motors Corp and said his counterparts at the United Auto Workers are having similar problems reaching a labor pact with the automaker. Basil ""Buzz"" Hargrove told reporters in a conference call that GM is trying to resist the U.S. pattern agreement set at Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Corp, which guarantee employment levels at 95 percent of the companies' current hourly workforces.   The provision is aimed at curbing the automakers' ability to shift work to outside suppliers, known as outsourcing, which also is the major sticking point in the CAW talks. ""I'd be quite happy if Steve were to get a settlement,"" Hargrove said of UAW President Stephen Yokich. ""He's having the same problem -- getting the pattern agreement with GM."" He said GM has ""agreed to the principle of limiting the outsourcing"" in the U.S."", but doesn't want to meet the 95 percent employment guarantee and wants to exclude parts plants it has on sale from the guarantee.   Talks between the UAW and GM have been low key during the Canadian strike. Negotiators have met only during normal business hours and do not plan to meet over the weekend. UAW spokesman Reg McGhee declined to characterize progress of the discussions, only to say bargainers were ""down to the larger issues."" But Hargrove has not asked Yokich to delay a U.S. settlement with GM during the Canadian strike. The CAW launched an escalating strike on October 3 and all the union's 26,000 GM workers were on the picket line by midnight on Wednesday.   The UAW has about 215,000 U.S. hourly workers at GM and, so far, only about 2,000 have been idled at an engine plant and a transmission plant. The strike may affect some of GM's U.S. plants next week, although the automaker canceled most overtime work this week. Hargrove said he saw no progress in talks with the automaker. ""I don't want to kid anybody,"" he said. ""It hasn't been very productive last few days, I do not believe it will be productive today."" Hargrove wanted the Canadian walkout to have as little effect on GM's U.S. production as possible so as to protect UAW workers and the profit-sharing checks they expect to receive this year. Prolonged shutdowns in the U.S. due to lack of Canadian-made parts could seriously hurt GM's profits and reduce profit sharing for employees. ",DavidLawder
"Ford Motor Co. said Friday it will pay $40 million for the right to put its name on the future home for the National Football League's Detroit Lions, a new domed stadium to be built in downtown Detroit. Ford, which has not yet chosen a formal name for the facility, will pay the fee over several years to Detroit's newly created stadium authority, which is developing the $225 million, 70,000-seat stadium for the Lions, other athletic and entertainment events and conventions. The facility is expected to be built on the edge of downtown Detroit, adjacent to a new, $240 million, open air ballpark for the Detroit Tigers baseball team. The deal follows a growing trend for major sports facilities to sell naming rights to corporations for millions of dollars. ""The value of having your company's name associated with a high-profile athletic facility is extraordinary,"" said Ford Chairman Alex Trotman. The deal leaves stadium backers about $10 million short of their fund-raising goals for the project. They face a Nov. 1 deadline to secure land purchases and raise $50 million in private and corporate contributions. ""I believe we will able to meet those conditions before Nov. 1,"" Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer told a news conference. Detroit area voters will be asked on Nov. 5 to approve new taxes on hotel rooms and car rentals to help finance the project through an $80 million bond issue. William Clay Ford Jr., a member of Ford's board of directors who is an owner of the Lions, said both he and his father, William Clay Ford, did not participate in any board discussions on the deal. ""It was truly an arm's length deal,"" said the younger Ford, who is leading the stadium project. Ford, 39, said the Lions and the stadium authority did not expect to get much of the remaining $10 million in funding from General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. Instead, they will seek funds from other companies, including automotive parts suppliers. Ford also said if the referrendum passes, the Lions will begin discussions with the city of Pontiac, Mich., for an early termination of the team's lease on the Pontiac Silverdome, which expires in 2004. The Silverdome, opened in 1975, would be the youngest U.S. major league sports facility to be replaced with a new venue. ",DavidLawder
"Second-shift workers at General Motors Corp. 's Cadillac assembly plant here will not report to work on Monday because of the Canadian Auto Workers strike and thousands more U.S. assembly employees may be laid off this week, GM said on Sunday. The Cadillac plant on the outskirts of Detroit will operate with only one shift on Monday and Tuesday, when it is expected to halt production completely unless the strike is resolved, GM spokesman Thomas Klipstine said. ""Once they run out of parts, that's it,"" he said. The plant employs more than 3,000 hourly workers represented by the United Auto Workers union, but Klipstine said he did not know the exact number of workers on each shift. The sprawling factory, which builds Cadillac's DeVille, Seville and Eldorado luxury cars, depends on interior trim parts made at a strike-bound plant in Windsor, Ontario, just across the Detroit River. GM's Canadian workers began an escalating strike on Oct. 3, shutting down all of the automaker's operations in Canada by late on Oct. 9. The company and union have been unable to reach an agreement for a new national labour contract for GM's 26,000 CAW members because of disagreements over the thorny issue of shifting parts work to outside suppliers, known as outsourcing. The union wants tough restrictions on outsourcing to protect its members' jobs, while GM, the least efficient automaker in North America, says it needs flexibility on parts purchases to become more competitive. So far, GM's U.S. operations have been relatively untouched by the strike in Canada, largely because the CAW gave the automaker ample warning that it was preparing to strike. That, coupled with the slow escalation of the strike over a week-long period, allowed GM to build up stocks of some parts and prepare for the walkout. ""The bottom line is there was no surprise with this strike,"" Klipstine said. ""We did as much as we could, but we don't have huge amounts of parts stockpiled."" Klipstine said he did not know how much longer GM could operate its U.S. plants. Industry analysts have said some of GM's plants may be able to continue to operate until the end of the month, particularly those that build GM's popular full-size pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles. On Friday, Ford Motor Co. President Alex Trotman said he did not believe his company would be able to gain a significant amount of market share due to the strike, because there has been ""little evidence"" that GM's hottest-selling truck lines will be affected. Most GM dealers have sufficient car inventories to weather the strike without turning away customers, he said. Thus far, the CAW has been responsible for the idling of only 2,000 U.S. workers. The walkout forced the layoff of 1,050 workers at an engine plant in Tonawanda, N.Y., near Buffalo, and 950 at a transmission plant in Ypsilanti, Mich., near Detroit. By contrast, a UAW strike in March at two Dayton, Ohio, brake plants had forced more than 55,000 of GM's workers off the job just one week after that walkout began. No formal talks were scheduled between GM and the CAW, although CAW President Buzz Hargrove was expected to be in contact with GM's chief negotiator, Dean Munger. Canada celebrates its national Thanksgiving Day holiday on Monday. Meanwhile, in the United States, negotiators working towards a contract for GM's 215,000 United Auto Workers members also took the weekend off.

"Chrysler Corp. said Monday it rode strong sales of its pickup trucks, minivans and sport/utility vehicles to a 92 percent jump in third-quarter profits, soundly beating Wall Street's optimistic forecasts. Detroit's No. 3 automaker earned $680 million, or 93 cents a share, in the July-September period, setting records for both net income and earnings per share for the third quarter. A year earlier, when Chrysler was struggling through the slow production launch of its current-generation minivans, the company earned just $354 million, or 45 cents a share. ""Chrysler's performance in the third quarter was outstanding,"" Chairman Robert Eaton said in a statement. ""It was fuelled by record-setting demand for our products, which led to a new third-quarter U.S. retail unit sales record and produced the best model year for U.S. retail unit sales in the company's history."" The results included an after-tax charge of $55 million, or 7 cents a share, to cover costs of an early retirement programme. About 531 salaried employees opted to leave the company under the programme during the quarter. Excluding the charge, Chrysler earned $735 million, or $1 a share, from operations, solidly exceeding Wall Street estimates. According to First Call, which tracks earnings estimates, analysts had expected Chrysler to earn about $520 million, or 71 cents a share. Chrysler shares jumped $1 to $32.75 after touching $33 on the New York Stock Exchange. ""I think it was all in the sales mix,"" Burnham Securities analyst David Healy said of Chrysler's strong performance. ""They've raised prices and the mix has shifted to trucks. They're selling not so many Neons and a lot more Jeep Grand Cherokees and Town &amp; Country minivans."" Indeed, light trucks -- which typically carry higher profit margins than passenger cars -- made up 66 percent of Chrysler's sales mix, versus 62 percent in the 1995 quarter. The automaker had full availability of its new minivans, and a St. Louis plant that had just started building Dodge Ram pickup trucks in August 1995 is now churning the vehicles out. Chrysler earned a profit of $982 on each vehicle in the quarter, almost double the $492 earned per vehicle a year earlier. Incentive spending fell to $685 per vehicle from $870 a year ago, but was up from $625 in the second quarter. Chrysler Chief Financial Officer Gary Valade said he expected similar conditions in the fourth quarter, and added that Chrysler next year plans another big increase in truck-building capacity. He told reporters on a conference call that the automaker will be able to build 190,000 more trucks in 1997 than in 1996, including the launch of a new Dodge sport/utility vehicle at Chrysler's Newark, Del., plant. The four-door vehicle is expected to be based on the new Dodge Dakota pickup truck that Chrysler is launching and will give Dodge dealers their first sport/utility vehicle since the two-door Ram Charger was discontinued in 1993. Valade said Chrysler will end the year with about 16.2 percent of the North American car and light truck market, but cautioned the company will be prudent when adding capacity. ""We don't feel ourselves share constrained at this 16 percent share level, but neither are we hell-bent to get to 20 (percent) at any cost,"" he said. Sales climbed to $14.4 billion, a third-quarter record and up 20 percent from $12.0 billion in the 1995 quarter. The automaker said it shipped 650,529 cars and trucks, up from 581,853 in the year-ago period, boosting its share of the combined U.S. and Canadian retail car and truck market to 15.5 percent from 13.6 percent in the third quarter of 1995. In the international market, Chrysler's retail sales were 57,209 vehicles, up 19 percent over the 48,207 vehicles it sold in the third quarter of 1995. In Europe, Chrysler vehicle sales rose 28 percent. The automaker said it bought back $452 million of its common stock in the quarter, bringing the total for 1996 to $1.6 billion, out of a $2 billion programme. The company bought back $1 billion worth of stock in 1995 and under its five-year peace accord with billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian, has pledged to buy back another $1 billion in 1997. For the nine months, earnings were $2.72 billion, or $3.65 a share, nearly triple the $985 million, or $1.28 a share, in the first nine months of 1995. ",DavidLawder
"Chrysler Corp., planning for a future without fear of financial crisis, said Tuesday it can boost its annual production capacity past 4 million vehicles and grab 20 percent of the U.S. car and truck market. Chrysler's top executives, in a series of briefings Tuesday, said the automaker was poised to boost its financial performance further through cost cuts, engineering innovations, new products and other initiatives. Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton said the automaker has not made market share a goal, but said an 18 percent to 20 percent share of the U.S. car and truck market ""is not unrealistic"" for Chrysler. Detroit's third-largest automaker held 16.2 percent of the market during the first nine months of 1996 -- roughly its highest share ever. After working to rebuild Chrysler's product line, operations and balance sheet after financial crises in 1980 and 1991, the automaker's management team is now focusing on long-term growth. ""For the first time in its history, this company doesn't have to spend every waking moment looking over its shoulder and worrying about its future,"" said Chrysler President Bob Lutz. ""We've moved beyond saying 'never again' to 'Why not?'"" Indeed, Eaton said he now believes that Chrysler can withstand a 10 percent to 20 percent drop in production and remain profitable -- something that was impossible five years ago. With a string of hit products, especially Jeeps and minivans, under its belt, the automaker is planning to boost capacity to 3.765 million vehicles by the year 2000 from 3.2 million this year. Included in those figures are a new Dodge sport utility vehicle that will go on sale in the fall of 1997. Industry analysts have said the vehicle will be called the Dodge Durango and will be based on the new Dakota compact pickup truck. The automaker could build up to 4.2 million vehicles annually in its current assembly plants if it adds third production shifts, said manufacturing Executive Vice President Dennis Pawley. That does not include the possible replacement of Chrysler's Toledo, Ohio, assembly plant. Eaton confirmed that the automaker was working with state and local officials to study replacement options for the 86-year-old facility, but has made no firm plans. Much of Chrysler's increased capacity will be aimed at overseas markets. The executive vice president of international operations, Thomas Gale, said Chrysler expected to double its international vehicle sales to 500,000 vehicles over the next three years from 250,000 this year. Gale said he believed Chrysler can ultimately sell more than 1 million vehicles overseas but did not offer a timetable. He showed off a prototype of a proposed ultra-low-cost car for emerging markets such as China, which features an all-plastic body and a two-cylinder, 0.8-litre engine made by Briggs &amp; Stratton Corp. The bare-bones car, which would not meet U.S. emissions and safety regulations, resembles France's discontinued but much-loved Citroen 2CV and could sell for $5,000 to $6,000. Eaton, who Monday announced surprisingly strong third-quarter earnings of $680 million, up from $365 million a year ago, outlined several financial goals for the automaker, without giving a timetable. They include: -- Boosting production by 6 percent a year. -- Cutting research and development spending to 2.5 percent of revenues from 2.7 percent. Ford Motor Co.'s spending rate is 5.9 percent of revenues, General Motors Corp. is at 5.5 percent and Toyota Motor Corp. is at 5.0 percent, Chrysler said. -- Cutting marketing costs to 6.3 percent of sales from 6.5 percent currently. -- Boosting return on sales to 8.0 percent from 6.5 percent for the first nine months of 1996 and 3.7 percent for the same period of 1995.

"Lear Corp., furthering its quest to supply complete car interiors, said Friday it agreed to buy the instrument panel and trim parts unit of Denmark-based Borealis Holding AB. Lear said it signed a memorandum of understanding to acquire Borealis Industrier AB for undisclosed terms. Based in Gothenburg, Sweden, Borealis Industrier manufacturers instrument panels, door panels, climate systems, exterior trim and various other components for the European car and truck industry. Borealis Industrier had 1995 sales of about $230 million and owns five plants in Sweden that employ about 1,800 people. Primary customers for the business include Swedish carmakers AB Volvo and Saab Automobile AB and truckmaker Scania AB. Borealis Holding is owned by Finnish state-controlled oil and energy group Neste Oy  and Norwegian state-owned oil group Statoil AS. Completion of the transaction is subject to approval by the Swedish competition authority and other conditions. Lear said the acquisition supports its strategy of having in-house capability to provide total automotive interior systems, including instrument panels. ""Not only does this acquisition strengthen relations with our European customers, but it positions Lear as the only independent automotive supplier in the world with in-house capabilities in all five interior systems -- broadening the appeal of our already strong one-stop-shopping competitive advantage,"" Lear Chairman Kenneth Way said in a statement.

"Ford Motor Co., which reported a $472 million loss in Europe this week, faces a long and difficult job to cut costs and jump-start its product line to deal with a sluggish European market and tough competition, analysts said Friday. Ford executives this week disclosed that they plan a broad effort to cut costs in Europe, including product costs, material costs, and personnel and plant costs. ""We need to restructure and we need to reduce our costs,"" Ford Vice President of Finance David McCammon told reporters. The cuts will include an early retirement programme that is expected to eliminate more than 2,000 jobs in Europe, he said. The initiatives, to be announced within the next three months, follow Ford's actions in 1993 to eliminate about 13,000 jobs from its Euoprean operations. Ford's $472 million European loss compared with a $320 million deficit a year ago, and was due partly to product launch costs. But analysts said there are no quick fixes to Ford's problems in Europe, which include high costs for its smaller cars and the lack of a competitive, high-volume large car. ""I don't think it's something that's corrected in one or two quarters,"" said PaineWebber analyst Michael Ward. ""We probably have another year or two where the news from Ford's European operations is not very good."" The automaker's production and parts suppliers are heavily concentrated in Germany, where costs are high and the company is more susceptible to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. General Motors Corp.'s assembly operations and suppliers are spread more evenly throughout Europe, giving the automaker a competitive advantage. Although the third quarter is typically the weakest period of the year because of vacations and model changeovers, GM's European operations earned $75 million during the third quarter, compared with a year-ago loss of $98 million -- a performance analysts attribute to extremely low investment costs and strong product acceptance. Shifting Ford's supplier base is a long-term task, as is cutting investment costs in new products. The first new cars developed under Ford's more efficient ""Ford 2000"" structure are not expected to be on the market for at least two more years, analysts said. The new Ford Ka minicar, developed for $250 million using off-the-shelf components, is a step in the right direction, but is expected to bring only razor thin profit margins, due to its low price, analysts said. Unlike in the United States, Ford in Europe cannot count on highly profitable light trucks and sport utility vehicles to make most of its money. It must rely on mostly small cars, including the Fiesta, Escort and the mid-size Mondeo. Ford's Scorpio large car, which was widely panned two years ago when it was last redesigned, has performed poorly against the likes of Bayerische Motoren Werke AG's 5-Series, GM's Opel Omega and the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. ""They have no money spinner in Europe,"" said Lehman Brothers auto analyst Joseph Phillippi. Ford's Mondeo, a strong seller, is still handicapped by its initial $6 billion development cost, which also included the Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique in the United States. Although the Mondeo received exterior and interior changes for the 1997 model year, competition in that segment of the market is much tougher than it was when the car first debuted in 1993. Opel's new Vectra, Audi AG's A4 and Volkswagen AG's new Passat are expected to draw many buyers away from the Mondeo. Making matters worse is the sluggish market. Analysts estimate that automakers have enough capacity to build 16 million cars in Europe, but sales this year will be only about 12.5 million, forcing deep price cuts. ""What's happening is there's an overcapacity situation in Europe,"" Ford's McCammon said. ""Everybody's fighting it out for market share and spending a lot of money for marketing incentives."" He said all European automakers, except for GM, have been struggling through the same problems. A decade ago, it was GM that was struggling in Europe and Ford was the top performer. ""I guess things switched,"" McCammon said. ""We had a great position of leadership and we're unhappy that we don't have that any more."" ",DavidLawder

Johnson Controls Inc., which has a strong seating business, recently acquired interior parts maker Prince Automotive, based in Holland Mich., for $1.35 billion in cash. Canada's Magna International Inc., one of the ""Big Three"" automotive interior firms along with Lear and Johnson Controls, recently acquired seat maker Douglas &amp; Lomason Co. for $135 million.

"The United Auto Workers union is discussing the possibility of an extended five- or six-year contract with the nation's largest automakers, UAW and company officials said Monday. The union is open to the idea of a contract longer than the typical three-year pact if it offers significant job security guarantees, officials said. ""It has surfaced in the subcommittees,"" said Carl Dowell, president of UAW Local 862 in Louisville, Ky. ""There was no problem with a longer-term agreement if it's fruitful for our people. Job security is the key."" Contract talks with General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. resumed Monday after meetings late last week between UAW President Stephen Yokich and the automakers' chairmen. The UAW has not yet chosen which company it will negotiate a pattern agreement with. Yokich said last week that he delayed the union's traditional choice of a ""strike target"" to allow the negotiating progress to continue at all three companies. A UAW spokesman said no decision on a target company is expected this week. Traditionally, the target is threatened with a national strike on the contract expiration date if no agreement is reached by then. The current pact, covering about 400,000 U.S. hourly workers at the three automakers, expires September 14. Ford spokesman Jon Harmon said the automaker suggested to the UAW about three weeks ago that both sides should examine possibly negotiating a longer-term contract. He said a longer agreement would stabilise Ford's future costs, allowing it to evaluate future product and investment decisions more accurately. ""It gives you more of a known quantity,"" he said. Yokich has said he would be open to a longer contract if the automakers ""want to buy it."" However, many UAW officials remain sceptical about a longer-term pact and say that removal of a strike threat every three years could invite abuses by the automakers. ""The question is how can GM live up to a five-year agreement when they can't live up to a three-year agreement?"" said Ed McNulty, president of UAW Local 14 at GM's Toledo, Ohio, truck transmission plant. Such an agreement would have to provide a mechanism for enforcement of the contract and for revisions to resolve local issues over sourcing and staffing levels that are sure to arise over the life of the contract, he said. GM has been hit by several strikes at individual plants over the current three-year contract over sourcing and jobs. ""You're going to have to have some good job security and outsourcing provisions for the membership to go for it,"" McNulty said. ",DavidLawder
"With a contentious, 20-day strike by the Canadian Auto Workers now behind it, General Motors Corp. could reach a U.S. labor agreement with the United Auto Workers in a matter of days, union officials said Wednesday. The UAW talks, which affect some 215,000 hourly workers, were moving quickly when the strike in Canada started on October 2 and stole the spotlight.   ""I think without question they would have settled by now, but the UAW did not want to undermine the Canadian union's negotiating stance,"" said Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor relations at the University of California-Berkeley. ""The (UAW) negotiations will move very quickly."" UAW president Stephen Yokich remains directly involved in the talks, and major unresolved issues are much the same as those that sparked the walkout in Canada: the shifting of work to outside suppliers, the sale of several parts plants and the UAW's demands for job guarantees for 95 percent of GM's workers.   Sources close to the talks said they believe GM will agree to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of its workforce -- nominally the same terms that rivals Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. agreed to -- but that level may exclude certain plants and may contain other exceptions. In addition to the two parts plants GM won the right to sell in Canada are two U.S. parts plants on the sale block. The automaker wants to sell a door hardware plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., which together employ 2,100 UAW members.   UAW officials have identified the buyer for all four of the U.S. and Canadian plants as Joseph, Littlejohn and Levy, a New York-based investment firm that owns other auto parts companies. But GM also wants to sell other components factories. Its Delphi Automotive Systems division has about 12 plants that it considers ""troubled."" And the automaker in August disclosed that was evaluating restructuring plans for parts plants other than the four now on the sale block.   A GM spokesman declined to discuss the talks, other than to say that GM and UAW negotiators were meeting Wednesday, as they have each weekday during the Canadian strike. ""We reamin hopeful we can get this resolved as soon as possible,"" UAW spokesman Reg McGhee said Wednesday. Shaiken said he believes that the GM-UAW agreement will largely continue the tradition of pattern bargaining for each of Detroit's Big Three automakers. Many analysts and even Yokich had downplayed the importance of maintaining a strict pattern for all three companies. ""What we're seeing is the continuation of pattern bargaining, and nonetheless, GM will be able to compete effectively under the agreement,"" Shaiken said. ",DavidLawder
"Adding to the controversy over the safety of automobile air bags, the federal government's auto safety agency said Thursday it was stepping up an investigation into spontaneous air bag deployments in several General Motors Corp. cars. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it has received five reports of air bags deploying without a collision in 1996-model GM mid-size sedans, due to corrosion in the air bag sensing and diagnostic module. In each case, water was spilled or leaked onto the floor of the vehicle. The probe involves 395,994 cars currently on the road, including the 1996 Chevrolet Lumina and Monte Carlo, Buick Regal, Pontiac Grand Prix and Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. In its monthly defect investigation report, NHTSA said three of the ""inappropriate deployments"" resulted in injuries, but none resulted in death. Four of the five cars were travelling between 10 and 40 mph when the bags inflated. News of the probe comes as the NHTSA is fielding growing numbers of calls from consumers worried about reports of child deaths caused by air bags. Air bags have saved the lives of more than 1,136 adults since 1986, said NHTSA spokeswoman Liz Neblett. But with inflation speeds of up to 200 mph, they also have killed 28 children since 1990. Earlier this week, NHTSA Executive Director Ricardo Martinez said the the agency advised that all children under the age of 12 should ride in the back seats of cars and trucks equipped with dual front air bags. The agency raised that age after 5-year-old Frances Ambrose was killed by an air bag in a Nashville, Tenn., crash despite properly wearing lap and shoulder belts. The NHTSA is now considering several remedies to the situation, including an auto industry request to reduce the inflation pressure of passenger air bags. Other alternatives include requiring ""smart"" air bag systems that have the ability to detect the size and weight of the occupant and adjust inflation accordingly. In the probe of the GM cars, NHTSA said all of the vehicles use an air bag sensing and diagnostic module that is located underneath the front passenger seat on top of the carpeting. It is not sealed, making it susceptible to moisture intrusion. NHTSA said owners of the vehicles reported that they: -- Spilled a glass of water on the vehicle floor. -- Drove through a car wash. -- Spilled a bucket of water on the vehicle floor. -- Spilled soapy water on the vehicle floor. -- Discovered a trunk leak in the vehicle. In addition, the agency said it was investigating two other instances of unexplained air bag deployment, one when a driver was backing out of a driveway and another when the car was driving at 20 mph. A GM spokesman said the automaker was cooperating with the probe. The company also uses the same air bag sensor on 1994 and 1995 model versions of the same cars, but reported only two instances of airbag deployments due to corrosion. In one case, GM said the vehicle was apparently flooded by an ocean tide, and in another case, the entire rear end of the vehicle was severely corroded. The investigation was upgraded to an engineering analysis, in which the agency will examine and physically test the components in question. ",DavidLawder
"Boosting the pressure on General Motors Corp. for a new labor agreement, the United Auto Workers union Friday set a Sunday night deadline for a strike against the world's largest automaker. UAW President Stephen Yokich said in a statment that union negotiators were not optimistic that a new contract deal could be reached by the deadline of 11:59 p.m. EST Sunday (0459 GMT Monday). While he did not say if the union's 215,000 GM hourly workers would actually strike, Yokich said the UAW had notified GM that it will terminate its extended 1993 contract with the automaker if the deadline passes with no agreement. The union typically does not work without a contract. ""UAW members have been advised to continue to work unless notified by their local union,"" Yokich said. ""The UAW bargaining team will continue to make serious efforts to achieve a new agreement. While we are not optimistic, we remain hopeful that this can be accomplished prior to the expiration of the current contract at 11:59 p.m. on Sunday,"" he added. The move comes just three days after GM settled a contentious, 20-day strike with the Canadian Auto Workers union that caused parts shortages that are still forcing the auto giant to shut down some U.S. assembly plants. Although the UAW talks had been moving quickly before the strike in Canada, people close to the negotiations said the two sides remain at odds over the union's demand for employment guarantees and GM's desire for flexibility to shift more parts work to outside, usually non-union suppliers. Both Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current work forces over the next three years. GM has resisted the pattern, saying it wants to exclude certain components plants from the employment guarantees. A GM spokesman said full-scale UAW negotiations at GM's Detroit headquarters will continue throughout the weekend for the first time since the strike in Canada began on Oct. 2. In a statement, GM chief negotiator Gerald Knechtel said, ""We remain committed to entering into agreement that balances the needs of our employees and the UAW with the flexibility GM needs to continue to improve our competitiveness."" ""We've had open and constructive dialogue with the UAW since the talks began and we're hopeful we can focus with the UAW on concluding these negotiations as soon as possible."" Meanwhile, GM continued to run out of Canadian-made parts at U.S. assembly plants. In Flint, Mich., local UAW officials said GM told more than 6,600 workers not to report to work at the automaker's massive Buick City complex on Monday. The facility makes Buick LeSabre, Oldsmobile 88 and Pontiac Bonneville sedans, as well as V-6 engines and other components. Buick City is the largest of several facilities to cut back production due to shortages of parts following the end of the Canadian Auto Workers' strike this week. On Thursday, GM laid off about 5,000 workers at its Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant in a shutdown that will last two weeks. The plant builds the popular Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire small cars. Also on Friday, GM notified some of the 2,926 workers at the nearby Lordstown metal stamping plant they would be idled next week. Another 474 workers at a components plant in Vandalia, Ohio, will be idled next week, GM said. Excluding the layoffs that will start next week, GM said it had a total of 23,340 workers idled in the United States and Mexico on Friday. GM's 26,000 Canadian Auto Workers members began returning to work on Wednesday after they ratified a new contract that puts some limits GM's ability to shift work to outside suppliers but allows the automaker to sell two contested parts plants.

"Negotiators for General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers union were back at the bargaining table on Saturday in an effort to reach a new national labor agreement before a Sunday night strike deadline. Bargainers, led by UAW President Stephen Yokich, reconvened about 8 a.m. (noon GMT) at GM's Detroit headquarters following a night off after the union's decision late on Friday to cancel its contract with the automaker at 11:59 p.m. EST Sunday (0459 GMT Monday). The deadline marks the first time the UAW threatened a strike in its 1996 negotiations with Detroit's Big Three automakers, which up to now have been marked by an unusually conciliatory tone and extremely secretive discussions. It also came days after GM's 26,000 Canadian Auto Workers members began returning to work on Wednesday following a three-week strike against the automaker's Canadian operations. In the U.S. talks the two sides were at odds over the same issues that caused the walkout in Canada -- the union's demand for job security and GM's desire to sell several parts plants and maintain flexibility to shift components work to outside suppliers, a practice known as outsourcing. In the U.S. negotiations GM wanted to modify the UAW contract pattern set by Ford   Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., which agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their UAW  workforces over the next three years. GM, the least efficient U.S. automaker, wanted to exclude certain components plants from the employment guarantees, including a door-hardware plant in Flint, Michigan, and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Michigan. Ford and Chrysler buy more of their parts from outside suppliers than GM does, often from firms that paid their workers significantly less than the $19-an-hour base wage paid in Big Three factories. Yokich said in a statment Friday that he was not optimistic that a deal could be reached before the deadline, but told workers to remain on the job until further notice. On Saturday UAW spokesman Reg McGhee declined to say whether the union was still pessimistic about the talks. ""That was yesterday's statement,"" McGhee said. ""We're just saying that the talks are continuing and we're not characterizing the progress."" GM spokesman Charles Licari said the automaker was prepared for round-the-clock negotiations, but declined to provide further details of the talks. GM's chief negotiator, Gerald Knechtel, said Friday that the automaker was ""committed to entering into agreement that balances the needs of our employees and the UAW with the flexibility GM needs to continue to improve our competitiveness."" GM flush with $14 billion in cash on its balance sheet and operating earnings that more than doubled in the third quarter to $1 billion, showed much willingness this year to sustain costly strikes in its continued quest for competitiveness. Industry analysts estimated the cost of the Canadian strike at $150 million to $450 million, while a 17-day strike at two Dayton, Ohio, brake plants in March reduced GM's first quarter profit by $900 million. In Dayton, GM preserved its right to buy a future brake system from an outside supplier, while in Canada, GM won the right to sell two parts plants in return for recognizing some limits on outsourcing. But the effects of the Canadian strike continued to linger last week, as more of GM's U.S. assembly plants plants ran out of Canadian-made parts.

"General Motors Co. and the United Auto Workers recessed contract negotiations early Monday, several hours after their existing contract expired, but union officials said talks were likely to resume later in the day. Union members continued working despite the impasse and UAW President Stephen Yokich said the union and GM officials planned to resume their talks, possibly later Monday. Bargaining between the two sides recessed about 3 a.m. EST after the contract expired. The pact covers 215,000 UAW members who work at GM's U.S. facilities. At a news conference Monday, Yokich made no mention of possible selective strikes at some GM plants, as had been speculated Sunday. ""We hope that everyone understands that we can't do it in the street. It isn't weakness -- we have to do it at the bargaining table,"" he said. Yokich said a small number of bargainers may return to GM later Monday. Negotiators talked for about 17 hours Sunday and early Monday morning trying to reach a new agreement. In a written statement in response to Yokich's comments, GM vice president of personnel Gerald Knechtel said the talks have been constructive. ""We have had open and constructive dialogue with the UAW since these talks began and have made significant progress on many of the issues,"" Knechtel said. The UAW has already reached a new three-year contract with Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. covering about 171,000 UAW members in the United States. Ford and Chrysler both agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current UAW workforces. Forcing GM to accept that pattern has been a sticking point for the UAW. The world's largest automaker has said it needs to shed about 12 North American parts plants that it says are uncompetitive, and wants to exclude those plants from any job guarantee pledges. There was speculation Sunday the UAW may hit GM with selective strikes at plants that build GM's high-profit full-size pickup trucks and sport/utility vehicles, including facilities in Janesville, Wis., Pontiac and Flint, Mich., and Fort Wayne, Ind. Yokich, who said he is disappointed with the progress of the talks, said some of the UAW's locals have ""sticky"" issues that are not yet resolved. ""We decided that some of these locals need to work on these issues probably before we can ever get a settlement,"" he said, declining to identify the locals. The previous national labor agreement expired Sept. 14, but the UAW said in September it would extend the contract. Last week Yokich said the contract extension for GM would end at midnight Sunday. Yokich defended his tactics against critics who say the union, which is facing a shrinking membership base, has not been tough enough on the Big Three automakers, whose profits and sales are both increasing. GM has 12 parts plants that it considers uncompetitive and wants to exclude several of those facilities from the job guarantee, including a door hardware plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., that it wants to sell. GM's stock slipped 12.5 cents to $54 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. ",DavidLawder
"A midnight Sunday strike deadline for General Motors Corp expired without a walkout as talks between the car maker and the United Auto Workers continued into the early morning hours on Monday. A GM spokesman declined to provide further details of the negotiations, saying the automaker would make a more detailed statement later on Monday morning. ""They're still on the job,"" said Norman Harp, a union commiteeman for UAW Local 14 at GM's Toledo, Ohio, transmission plant, which started its third shift shortly before midnight Sunday. ""The deadline's here and gone and they're still talking,"" Harp said of the negotiators at GM's Detroit headquarters. Local UAW officials at other GM plants also said they were told to stand by for further instructions. The UAW cancelled its national contract covering 215,000 GM hourly workers one minute before midnight Sunday in a move to increase pressure on GM for tentative agreement. However, there was speculation among UAW officials late Sunday that instead of a national strike, the union could strike selected plants that make GM's high-profit light trucks. Top on the list of such facilities were GM's Janesville, Wis., plant, which makes Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon and Suburban full-size sport/utility vehicles, and the Pontiac, Mich., plant, which makes GM's popular full-size pickup trucks with extended cabs. A selective strike at those facilities would inflict pain on GM while minimizing the drain on the UAW's strike fund, which pays each UAW worker $150 a week. It also would blunt some of the political fallout from a massive strike close to the U.S. presidential election. UAW officials say the two sides remain at odds over the union's demand that GM follow the pattern set at Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Corp by guaranteeing employment for 95 percent of its current UAW workforce. GM, which has 12 parts plants that it considers uncompetitive, wants to exclude several of those facilities from the guarantee, including a door hardware plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., that it wants to sell. In settling the Canadian strike last week, GM was able to secure a deal that included the selling of two parts plants in Windsor and Oshawa, Ontario and retained some flexibility to outsource more products. However, GM agreed to guarantee pensions for workers in the two plants or up to nine years and to allow them to transfer back to jobs that open up in other GM facilities. GM still has more than 20,000 workers in the United States and Mexico idled because of lingering parts shortages associated with the Canadian strike. ",DavidLawder
"General Motors Corp. workers remained on the job without a contract Monday as United Auto Workers President Stephen Yokich refrained -- for now -- from calling a strike against the auto giant. Negotiations on a new national labor contract covering GM's 215,000 UAW hourly workers recessed early Monday after a midnight strike deadline passed. Yokich said some bargainers would resume talks later in the day. ""The only place you can settle these agreements is at the bargaining table,"" Yokich told a news conference early Monday. ""We feel that with or without a contract in place, we can continue (working). It's open-ended."" The union plans to bring its plant-level leaders to Detroit for a meeting on the talks on Saturday, a move that typically comes after a tentative agreement is reached. Although Yokich played down the threat of a strike on Monday, he said some of the more than 100 local unions at GM plants may resort to walkouts unless the automaker meets union demands in separate negtiations for local labor agreements. The local talks have become a sticking point for the national negotiations, Yokich said, because only a few of the locals have signed agreements with GM. The local pacts typically cover plant-specific issues such as work rules and health and safety standards, while the national contract covers wages, benefits, job security and other common issues. ""We decided that some of these locals need to work on these issues probably before we can ever get a settlement,"" Yokich said, declining to identify specific plants or issues. Nevertheless, he urged anxious UAW members who watched their Canadian counterparts strike for three weeks this month to stay on the job for the time being. ""We hope that everyone understands that we can't do it in the street. It isn't weakness -- we have to do it at the bargaining table,"" he said. Negotiations at GM's headquarters building here continued for 17 hours until about 2 a.m. EST on Monday, when bargainers began leaving, carrying their overnight bags. Although some talks were scheduled to resume Monday afternoon, Yokich and other top UAW officers do not plan to return to the bargaining table until Tuesday morning. In a written statement in response to Yokich's comments, GM Vice President of Personnel Gerald Knechtel said the talks have been constructive. ""We have had open and constructive dialogue with the UAW since these talks began and have made significant progress on many of the issues,"" Knechtel said. Yokich chided GM's hard-headed negotiating style as ""typical GM,"" and noted that the union has consistently had a better relationship with Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. The UAW wants GM to agree to the same job guarantees granted by Ford and Chrysler, which call for the two companies to guarantee employment for 95 percent of their combined 171,000 UAW members in the United States. GM has 12 North American parts plants that it considers uncompetitive and wants to exclude several of those facilities from the job guarantee pledges, including a door hardware plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., that it wants to sell. Although GM is viewed as the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three automakers, Yokich insisted that the auto giant can live with the pattern. ""I think Ford and Chrysler understood when we said we're preparing ourselves and our union to enter the 21st Century with you as partners in the corporation,"" he said. ""I'm not too sure GM understands that. They've always been late bloomers. Maybe they'll get the message sooner or later."" The UAW's strike threat comes less than a week after GM settled a 20-day strike by the independent Canadian Auto Workers union. The CAW struck over many of the same issues -- job security and shifting jobs to outside suppliers. UAW Vice President Richard Shoemaker said the U.S. union did not feel pressure to get the exact same provisions that GM agreed to in Canada. GM's stock slipped 12.5 cents to $54 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. ",DavidLawder
"General Motors Co. and the United Auto Workers recessed contract negotiations early Monday, several hours after their existing contract expired, but union officials said talks were likely to resume later in the day. Union members continued working despite the impasse and UAW President Stephen Yokich said the union and GM officials planned to resume their talks, possibly later Monday. Bargaining between the two sides recessed about 3 a.m. EST after the contract expired. The pact covers 215,000 UAW members who work at GM's U.S. facilities. At a news conference Monday, Yokich made no mention of possible selective strikes at some GM plants, as had been speculated Sunday. ""We hope that everyone understands that we can't do it in the street. It isn't weakness -- we have to do it at the bargaining table,"" he said. Yokich said a small number of bargainers may return to GM later Monday. Negotiators talked for about 17 hours Sunday and early Monday morning trying to reach a new agreement. In a written statement in response to Yokich's comments, GM vice president of personnel Gerald Knechtel said the talks have been constructive. ""We have had open and constructive dialogue with the UAW since these talks began and have made significant progress on many of the issues,"" Knechtel said. The UAW has already reached a new three-year contract with Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. covering about 171,000 UAW members in the United States. Ford and Chrysler both agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current UAW workforces. Forcing GM to accept that pattern has been a sticking point for the UAW. The world's largest automaker has said it needs to shed about 12 North American parts plants that it says are uncompetitive, and wants to exclude those plants from any job guarantee pledges. There was speculation Sunday the UAW may hit GM with selective strikes at plants that build GM's high-profit full-size pickup trucks and sport/utility vehicles, including facilities in Janesville, Wis., Pontiac and Flint, Mich., and Fort Wayne, Ind. Yokich, who said he is disappointed with the progress of the talks, said some of the UAW's locals have ""sticky"" issues that are not yet resolved. ""We decided that some of these locals need to work on these issues probably before we can ever get a settlement,"" he said, declining to identify the locals. The previous national labour agreement expired Sept. 14, but the UAW said in September it would extend the contract. Last week Yokich said the contract extension for GM would end at midnight Sunday. Yokich defended his tactics against critics who say the union, which is facing a shrinking membership base, has not been tough enough on the Big Three automakers, whose profits and sales are both increasing. GM has 12 parts plants that it considers uncompetitive and wants to exclude several of those facilities from the job guarantee, including a door hardware plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., that it wants to sell. GM's stock slipped 12.5 cents to $54 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. ",DavidLawder
"United Auto Workers bargainers reconvened at General Motors Corp.'s headquarters Tuesday following a day off Monday, but talks between the two sides maintained a low profile, UAW and company spokesmen said. UAW workers continued to report to their jobs at GM's U.S. factories, despite the expiration of their national labour agreement with the automaker at 11:59 p.m. EST Sunday. GM spokesman Charles Licari said there were no major ""main-table"" meetings scheduled Tuesday, but key negotiators were communicating in small groups and by telephone. ""Discussions are taking place, but there is no set timetable regarding the negotiations,"" Licari said, adding that such communications still may prove fruitful. A person close to the talks said, however, that he did not expect the situation to change much before Saturday, when the union's key local GM plant-level leaders are scheduled to meet in Detroit. UAW President Stephen Yokich recessed the talks on Monday and expressed disappointment with the lack of progress toward a settlement, but he refrained from calling a strike against the world's largest automaker. Still, Yokich said some of the union's GM locals may resort to strikes if progress in local negotiations does not improve. In addition to the national contract, GM is negotiating with more than 100 UAW locals for pacts that cover plant-specific issues. In New York on Tuesday, GM Chairman Jack Smith said little about the UAW negotiations, but told reporters that he hoped there would be no local strikes. The threat of additional strikes comes less than a week after Canadian Auto Workers members returned to work following a three-week walkout over the issues of job security and outsourcing, or the shifting of work to outside contractors. Smith, speaking at a news conference on alternative fuel vehicles, declined to specify the dollar cost of the strike. ""We lost quite a few cars,"" he said. GM said Tuesday that 22,913 workers in its U.S. assembly, powertrain and stamping operations remained idle because of lingering shortages of Canadian-made parts. The automaker said it laid off an additional 465 workers at its Lordstown, Ohio, metal stamping plant Tuesday, one of four such plants affected. GM's nearby Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant remains completely idled, as does its Buick City assembly plant in Flint, Mich. Five other assembly plants remain partially idled, bringing GM's laid off assembly workers to 15,284. GM has 5,702 engine and transmission workers laid off, with six such powertrain plants partially idled. In the UAW talks, which cover a total of 215,000 U.S. hourly workers, GM has resisted the union's demand that it follow a pattern set by Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. and guarantee jobs for 95 percent of current work force over the next three years. GM wants to exclude from the guarantee several parts plants that it wants to sell. The automaker has identified 12 facilities that it considers uncompetitive. GM's stock gained 50 cents to $54.375 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. ",DavidLawder
"General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers resumed contract negotiations Wednesday under the threat of additional strikes as local walkouts continued in Wisconsin and Indiana. Bargainers reconvened at GM's headquarters here Wednesday morning but GM spokesman Charles Licari declined to say if GM Chairman Jack Smith was directly involved in the talks. ""Talks are taking place at all levels,"" Licari said. About 2,750 members of United Auto Workers Local 23 struck GM's Indianapolis metal stamping plant Tuesday night and 4,800 workers also walked off the job at GM's Janesville, Wis., truck assembly plant. UAW spokesman Reg McGhee said no other local strikes had started as of Wednesday morning, but said the union was not ruling out other actions. UAW President Stephen Yokich raised the threat of local strikes on Monday after the union's national contract with GM expired. ""Steve made it clear that without a national contract, the locals are on their own,"" McGhee said, noting that they do not have to provide GM with the typical five-day notice before a walkout. Although UAW officials said the strikes were called over local issues, the actions increased pressure on GM for a national agreement by threatening to paralyse much of the lucrative light truck operations at the world's largest automaker. The local walkouts thus may nudge GM into a tentative national agreement before Saturday, when the UAW's 250-member National GM Council is scheduled to meet in Detroit. The council, made up of plant-level leaders, would have to approve any agreement. A major sticking point in the national talks covering 215,000 workers is the future of 12 domestic parts plants GM considers uncompetitive. GM wants to exclude several of the plants from union demands that it guarantee employment for 95 percent of UAW workers over the next three years. Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have already granted such guarantees, but GM, the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three automakers, wants changes to the pattern to allow it to cut costs. A national agreement probably would also require the signatures of Smith and Yokich. McGhee said Yokich was not at GM headquarters Wednesday morning but was involved in the talks. ""His physical presence is not demanded for every meeting we have with GM,"" McGhee said. Workers at all of GM's truck and truck parts plants have been working heavy overtime in recent months, putting a strain on workers and leading to union demands for relief. For example, at the Janesville plant, which makes the Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon sport utility vehicles, UAW Local 95 has pressed GM to hire a third shift of workers. The Indianapolis plant supplies doors, fenders, hoods and other parts to nine of the automaker's 11 North American truck assembly plants. At least some of those plants likely will have to halt operations within days due to parts shortages. Only a handful of GM's 123 local units have signed new local contracts with the automaker. The pacts typically cover items such as work rules, staffing levels and health and safety standards, while the national agreement covers wages, benefits, job security and other broad issues. While GM has refused to identify the plants it wants to sell, the list includes a door hinge plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., officials said. Together, the plants employ 2,100 UAW members. The local strikes mark a departure in Yokich's bargaining strategy, which until last week had been marked by unusually conciliatory remarks and virtually no strike threats. The walkouts also came less than a week after Canadian Auto Workers members returned to work following a three-week strike over the issues of job security and shifting work to outside contractors.

"The United Auto Workers union unleashed two local strikes against General Motors Corp.'s truck operations Tuesday night in bids to boost pressure on the automaker for new national and local labor agreements.

"General Motors Corp.  has packed its new EV1 electric vehicle with exotic materials and sophisticated, unproven technology, but is taking a cautious approach to introducing it to the public. GM officials said Tuesday they plan to offer the two-seat car only on three-year leases and will hold the customer's hand virtually every step of the way. ""Our total focus is to provide a hassle-free experience and comprehensive customer care,"" said Joseph Kennedy, vice president of sales and marketing for GM's Saturn unit, which will sell the EV1 under the GM nameplate. The first modern production car designed from the ground up to be an electric vehicle, the EV1 will roll into Saturn dealerships sometime this fall in the Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz., areas. Colder climates would shorten the vehicles' already limited range, which is a maximum of 70 to 90 miles under ideal conditions, GM says. California, which recently eased its 1998 mandate for electric vehicles, is expected to offer consumer incentives for the vehicle. Depending on such incentives, monthly lease payments on the car will probably fall between $400 and $500, about the same as a $30,000 luxury car, GM officials said at a news briefing. Customers will have to add another $50 a month or so to lease a 220-volt charging unit and pay to have it mounted in their garage. But the electricity to run the EV1 is a bargain -- about a penny a mile, versus gasoline costs of four to five cents a mile for an average normal car. GM executives will not discuss production plans or sales targets for the vehicle and say they plan to let market dictate demand. But Kennedy said he expects the initial demand to outstrip supply due to the vehicle's novelty. So far, about 1,000 people have called a toll-free telephone number, and dealers have taken names of 300 serious customers, including Tonight Show host Jay Leno, he said. Customers who want performance won't be disappointed with the EV1. The whisper-quiet vehicle offers neck-snapping acceleration and sports-car like handling, although a heavy foot will quickly drain the battery, requiring a three- to four-hour recharge. ""We can keep up with a Nissan 300ZX from zero to 30"" miles an hour, said Sean McNamara, marketing manager for GM's Advanced Technology Vehicles group. The car's aerodynamic tear-drop shape, considerably narrower in the rear than in the front, slips through the wind easily and looks unlike anything else on the road. GM could have built a spartan small boxy car but wanted its first electric vehicle to have some flair, said Robert Purcell, general manager of GM Advanced Technology Vehicles. ""This is the car that gets the market started,"" he said. ""We wanted to put out a car that was very exciting so that people would fall in love with it."" The sporty configuration was aimed at highly educated customers with incomes of $125,000 a year who like high technology, GM said. The customers also likely own two other vehicles for longer trips or heavy hauling. Saturn, which won't necessarily sell all future GM electric vehicles, plans to emphasise its customer-friendly sales practices more heavily for the EV1. The decision to lease the vehicle was made in part to protect consumers from the inevitable march of technology. The automaker does not want EV1 customers to be stuck with obsolete cars in a few years, as personal computer owners often are. At the end of the lease, GM is considering refitting the plastic and aluminum-bodied cars with newer technology and leasing them again, Purcell said. The division also is training about 14 EV1 ""product specialists"" to handle sales of the vehicle at 26 designated dealerships in California and Arizona. The specialists will come to a prospective customer's home, office, or elsewhere to explain the details of the car and the charging unit. They'll work with the utility companies and arrange municipal permits for the installations, Kennedy said, adding that it will probably take about a week to set up a customer with a car and charger. GM has invested $350 million in developing the EV1, which it does not expect to recoup through sales of the first generation vehicle, Purcell said. But the car does pioneer a wide range of exotic materials and new technology that could find its way to other GM vehicles. Magnesium and other lightweight materials counteract the weight of batteries, and the cars have braking systems that transfer power back to the battery. Despite the technology, the cars are largely hand-built at a Lansing, Mich., plant that produced the now-defunct Buick Reatta in the late 1980s. The operation employs 54 production workers but could be expanded quickly, GM officials said. ",DavidLawder
"Negotiators from General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers union appeared to be grinding toward a national contract deal Thursday as a local strike at a metal stamping plant threatened the automaker with As a marathon bargaining session that started at 10 a.m. EST Wednesday wore on, UAW officials said the two sides were closer to an agreement, but disagreements over job guarantees and plants on the selling block remained an obstacle. UAW President Stephen Yokich was meeting in Detroit Thursday with members of the union's executive board, a body that would have to approve any deal. He was expected to return to the talks at GM's headquarters later Thursday. ""The feeling I had around here this morning was that there was some progress made last night,"" said UAW spokesman Reg McGhee. He declined to characterise the pace of talks Thursday afternoon. Meanwhile, plant-level union officials said the number of workers idled by local strikes in Indianapolis and Janesville, Wis., could reach nearly 21,000 by Saturday. GM truck plants in Moraine, Ohio, and Flint, Mich., were expected to run out of fenders, hoods, and other sheet-metal parts from GM's strikebound Indianapolis stamping plant by late Thursday night, officials at the plants said. Flint employs about 2,000 workers and builds crew-cab and heavy-duty full-size pickup trucks, while Moraine employs about 4,000 and builds Chevrolet Blazer and GMC Jimmy compact sport/utility vehicles. ""B-crew will come in tonight and that'll be it,"" said George Dunaway, vice president of International Union of Electronics Workers Local 801 in Moraine. Although his union is not involved in the UAW talks, he supports the strikers in Indianapolis and Janesville, Wis. ""A lot of their concerns are our concerns,"" he said. The remainder of the nine GM truck plants fed by Indianapolis are expected to halt operations soon. GM's Shreveport, La., compact pickup truck plant is scheduled to shut down during the day Friday, idling 2,500 workers, and the Linden, N.J. plant, which employs 2,500 and builds both compact pickups and sport/utility vehicles, will shut down Friday night. GM's Fort Wayne plant laid off about 2,250 of its 2,600 workers as it halted production of GM's popular full-size Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks Wednesday night. GM's other full-size truck plants in Pontiac, Mich., Oshawa, Ontario, and Silao, Mexico, are expected to follow close behind. The strikes on Tuesday by 2,750 workers at Indianapolis and 4,800 workers in Janesville, Wis., have formed a two-pronged effort to squeeze GM's highly profitable light truck operations, increasing pressure for national and local settlements. The shutdown of the Janesville plant alone could cost GM $50 million a week in pre-tax profits, adding to pressure on the automaker for national and local contract settlements, said David Healy, an auto analyst with Burnham Securities. The southern Wisconsin factory is the sole source for GM's popular four-door, full-size Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and GMC Yukon sport utility vehicles. Analysts estimate that GM makes an average of $9,000 in variable profits on each of the trucks. Meanwhile, other UAW locals sought to join the Indianapolis and Janesville walkouts. GM's Kokomo, Ind., electronics plant requested permission to send about 5,500 workers out on strike. A walkout at that facility would be particularly damaging to GM because it supplies all of the automaker's North American assembly plants with engine electronics, audio systems and other parts. The future of 12 domestic parts plants that GM considers uncompetitive remained a major sticking point in the negotiations. GM wants to exclude several of the plants from union demands that it guarantee employment for 95 percent of UAW workers over the next three years. Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have already granted such guarantees, but GM, the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three automakers, wants changes to the pattern to allow it to cut costs..

"A strike at General Motors Corp.'s Indianapolis metal stamping plant is expected to force two more GM truck assembly plants to shut down Thursday night, ratcheting up the United Auto Workers union's bargaining pressure on the automaker. A GM source said the two truck plants will run out of parts from Indianapolis late Thursday night during their second production shifts, joining a plant in Fort Wayne, Ind., that shut down Wednesday night. The Fort Wayne plant laid off about 2,250 of its 2,600 workers as it halted production of GM's popular full-size Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks. The official declined to identify the plants, but said they will be among several still-operating truck facilities that receive hoods, fenders and other large body panels from Indianapolis, including Pontiac and Flint, Mich.; Oshawa, Ontario; Linden, N.J.; Shreveport, La.; Moraine, Ohio; and Silao, Mexico. The strike by 2,750 workers at Indianapolis and a second walkout by 4,800 workers in Janesville, Wis., have formed a two-pronged effort to squeeze GM's highly profitable light truck operations. Meanwhile, GM and the UAW continued a more than 24-hour bargaining session Thursday in an effort to hammer out a new national labour contract covering 215,000 GM hourly workers. The marathon session, which started at about 10 a.m. EST, was the longest so far between the union and the world's largest automaker, said GM spokesman Charles Licari. He declined to comment on any progress being made. Typically, negotiators in labour contract talks for Detroit's Big Three automakers meet for long periods to work out final details just before reaching a tentative agreement. But analysts say the dollar cost of lost truck production due to the Indianapolis and Janesville strikes could mount quickly, shutting off GM's biggest source of profits. The shutdown of the Janesville plant alone could cost GM $50 million a week in pre-tax profits, adding to pressure on GM for national and local contract settlements, said David Healy, an auto analyst with Burnham Securities. The southern Wisconsin factory is the sole source for GM's popular four-door, full-size Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and GMC Yukon sport utility vehicles. Analysts estimate that GM makes an average of $9,000 in variable profits on each of the trucks. As its truck operations grind toward a halt, the company's U.S. car assembly plants affected by a three-week strike in Canada earlier this month are starting to come back to life. GM said Thursday that 4,200 idled workers returned to their jobs at car plants in Flint, Mich., and Fairfax, Kansas, cutting the total number of U.S. workers laid off due to the Canadian Auto Workers walkout to 19,958. The future of 12 domestic parts plants that GM considers uncompetitive has been a major sticking point in the negotiations. GM wants to exclude several of the plants from union demands that it guarantee employment for 95 percent of UAW workers over the next three years. Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have already granted such guarantees, but GM, the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three automakers, wants changes to the pattern to allow it to cut costs. GM has already put two of the 12 plants on the sale block -- a door hinge plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., that together employ 2,100 workers.

"Local strikes in Wisconsin and Indiana began taking a larger toll on General Motors Corp. truck operations Wednesday, increasing pressure on the automaker for a new national contract with the United Auo Workers union. GM said the walkout that started Tuesday night at its Indianapolis metal stamping plant forced the company to lay off 2,250 workers at its Fort Wayne, Ind., plant and halt production of full-size Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks. The plant ran out of hoods, doors, fenders and other major body panels made by striking workers in Indianapolis, said GM spokesman Jeffrey Kuhlman. No other plants were in immediate danger of halting production Wednesday night, but the strikebound Indianapolis plant has stopped shipments to nine of GM's 11 North American truck assembly plants, threatening more shutdowns within days. Meanwhile talks between GM and UAW bargainers continued late into the night Wednesday in an effort to reach a new national agreement covering 215,000 GM hourly workers. Company officials declined to comment on progress of the negotiations. Analysts said Wednesday the cost of the strikes by 2,750 workers in Indianapolis and 4,800 workers at its Janesville, Wis., truck assembly plant could mount quickly, eating into profits from GM's lucrative light truck operations. The shutdown of the Janesville plant alone could cost GM $50 million a week in pre-tax profits, said David Healy, an auto analyst with Burnham Securities. The southern Wisconsin factory, which employs 4,800 workers, is the sole source for GM's popular four-door, full-size Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and GMC Yukon sport utility vehicles. Analysts estimate that GM makes about $9,000 in variable profits on each of the trucks. In addition to Janesville and Fort Wayne, the Indianapolis plant supplies facilities in Pontiac and Flint, Mich.; Oshawa, Ontario; Linden, N.J.; Shreveport, La.; Moraine, Ohio, and Silao, Mexico. ""It really starts to add up quickly when you add in all of the other big C/K pickups they can lose,"" said Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi. The UAW strikes came as GM continued to stagger from a three-week strike in Canada that curtailed production at a number of U.S. plants and may cost up to $450 million. On Wednesday GM said it still had 23,158 U.S. workers idled due to shortages of Canadian-made parts, but added that 3,200 workers at its Buick City assembly plant in Flint, Mich., were scheduled to return to work on Thursday. No other UAW strikes had started on Wednesday, but UAW spokesman Reg McGhee said the union was not ruling out other walkouts. UAW President Stephen Yokich raised the threat of local strikes on Monday after GM's national contract covering 215,000 UAW workers expired. ""Steve made it clear that without a national contract, the locals are on their own,"" McGhee said, noting that they do not have to provide GM with the typical five-day notice before a walkout. Some UAW officials speculated that other stamping and parts plants may also be struck but others expressed concern that widespread walkouts so close to next week's national election would hurt Democratic candidates. Although UAW officials said the strikes were called over local issues, analysts said it was clear that the actions were aimed at pushing GM into a tentative national agreement. That may take place before Saturday, when about 250 UAW leaders from GM plants across the nation are scheduled to meet in Detroit to discuss the status of the talks. The future of 12 domestic parts plants that GM considers uncompetitive remained a major sticking point in the negotiations Wednesday. GM wants to exclude several of the plants from union demands that it guarantee employment for 95 percent of UAW workers over the next three years. Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have already granted such guarantees, but GM, the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three automakers, wants changes to the pattern to allow it to cut costs. GM has already put two of the 12 plants on the sale block -- a door hinge plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., that together employ 2,100 workers.

"Local strikes in Wisconsin and Indiana began taking their toll on the rest of General Motors Corp.'s truck production Wednesday, clouding the automaker's national contract talks with the United Auto Workers. GM said the day-old walkout at its Indianapolis metal stamping plant would force it to halt production of full-size Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks at its Fort Wayne, Ind., assembly plant Wednesday night. The Indianapolis walkout on Tuesday has halted shipments of major steel body panels to nine of GM's 11 North American truck assembly plants, threatening to shut them down within days.

National contract talks continued Wednesday at GM's Detroit headquarters, but officials declined to say whether progress was being made. ""Talks are taking place at all levels,"" said GM spokesman Charles Licari. Although UAW officials said the strikes were called over local issues, analysts said it was clear that the actions were aimed at pushing GM into a tentative national agreement.

"General Motors Corp.'s board of directors will likely delay an increase in the company's quarterly common stock dividend if it fails to reach a contract deal with the United Auto Workers union before Monday, analysts said Friday. GM's board is scheduled to meet on Monday and will consider the automaker's fourth quarter dividend, but Dean Witter analyst Ron Glantz said an increase will send the wrong message to the union.   ""Unless a settlement is reached by Sunday, the board is not going to throw gasoline onto the fire,"" said Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. auto analyst Ron Glantz. A dividend hike now could jeopardize the long-running UAW talks because the automaker is trying to win concessions aimed at cutting costs and allowing it sell off unprofitable parts plants. The two sides are crafting a complicated agreement that is expected to maintain job guarantees set by Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Corp, but may exclude a number of GM facilities.   Nevertheless, analysts say GM is due for an increase because of the company's improving cash position and stronger earnings. The quarterly payout rate on GM's $1-2/3 par-value stock has been unchanged since February, when it was raised to $0.40 a share from $0.30. Glantz's anticipation of an increase in the dividend and a possible share buyback program was predicated upon having an agreement in hand. Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi agreed but he noted that GM needs to increase its payout to improve its dividend yield. GM's yield is now 2.98 percent, compared with 4.93 percent for Ford Motor Co and 4.16 percent for Chrysler Corp. ""Shareholders might be better served by letting that sleeping dog lie,"" Phillippi said of a possible dividend increase. He added that he expects shareholders to remain patient with GM, because the automaker has more to gain by negotiating a UAW contract that allows it reduce its cost disadvantage compared with Ford and Chrysler. Once a contract is signed, Phillippi said he is looking for GM to raise its dividend by 50 percent, or $0.20 a share, in two increments. GM shares were up 1/8 at 54. ",DavidLawder
"In a sign that agreement on a labour contract between General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers may still have significant hurdles, the union said Friday it cancelled a meeting of its National GM Council that was scheduled here for Saturday. The council, made up of about 250 plant-level leaders at GM locals across the country, was expected to vote on a tentative agreement covering GM's 215,000 UAW workers. UAW spokesman Reg McGhee declined to give a reason for the cancellation, but said the council will meet instead on Wednesday, Nov. 6, in Chicago, if the union reaches an agreement with GM in the next few days. One official close to the talks said the meeting was cancelled because the union did not reach a deal in time to print up summaries for the GM council members to review on Saturday. He did not rule out reaching an agreement on Friday. ""They're working on trying to resolve the final issues,"" GM spokesman Gerry Holmes said. Still, the cancellation was viewed as a negative sign for the GM contract talks, which had resumed Friday after bargainers rested up before making another push for a tentative agreement. They bargained for 32 hours on Wednesday and Thursday, fuelling optimism that a settlement was near. The two sides have been haggling over the total number of hourly workers that GM will guarantee to maintain over the next three years. Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current hourly workforces, but GM wants to exclude several parts plants from the guarantees. GM, the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three, wants changes to the pattern to allow it to cut costs and shift more parts work to outside suppliers. GM is expected to match the Ford and Chrysler wage package, which calls for a $2,000 bonus in the first year, and 3 percent base wage increases in the second and third years. Meanwhile, the toll of lost profits and idled workers from local strikes in Janesville, Wis., and Indianapolis continued to mount for GM. Including 2,750 strikers at the Indianapolis metal stamping plant and 4,809 at the Janesville truck assembly plant, GM said the walkouts had idled a total of 13,309 workers by midday Friday. Another 2,400 were scheduled to be sent home from GM's Shreveport, La., plant later Friday afternoon, and up to 2,500 workers in Linden, N.J., were told not to report to work on Monday. The two factories are among nine GM truck plants in North America that receive fenders, hoods, roofs and other major body panels from Indianapolis. Michael Ward, an auto analyst at Paine Webber, said the Janesville, Fort Wayne and Moraine shutdowns alone will cost GM $10 million a day in after-tax lost profits. ""We're looking at $10 million a day right now, and that could easily expand to $20 million by Monday,"" Ward said. About 3,500 workers were idled at GM's Moraine, Ohio, compact sport utility vehicle plant Thursday night, while 2,250 workers were laid off at GM's Fort Wayne, Ind., full-size pickup truck assembly plant on Wednesday night. In addition, 900 workers who build V-8 engines for trucks assembled in Janesville and Fort Wayne were idled on Friday. A full-size truck plant in Flint, Mich., had been expected to be idled Thursday night, but union officials said GM diverted enough parts to keep it running several more days. ""GM'll start funnelling the parts around to the plants that they want to keep going,"" said Doug Bellamy, vice president of UAW Local 598 in Flint. Layoffs from the UAW strikes are increasing as GM's U.S. car operations are still staggering from the effects of the three-week Canadian Auto Workers strike, which ended Oct. 23. GM said it still had 18,958 workers idled by continuing shortages of Canadian-made parts at six car assembly plants, six engine and transmission plants and four metal stamping facilities.

"After meeting for nearly 32 hours, most bargainers for General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers union adjourned talks without a national contract deal Thursday night as several more truck plants headed for strike-related shutdowns. ""Talks in several specific areas will continue tonight,"" said GM spokesman Charles Licari. ""Full negotiations will resume Friday morning as bargainers continue their efforts to reach a tentative agreement."" He declined to identify the areas to be discussed Thursday night. Talks ""have snagged several times in the past week,"" said Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor relations at the University of California-Berkeley. ""The pressure's been increased considerably by the two plants that are out on strike."" Indeed, plant-level union officials said the number of workers idled by local strikes in Indianapolis and Janesville, Wis., could reach nearly 21,000 by Saturday. GM truck plants in Moraine, Ohio, and Flint, Mich., were expected to run out of fenders, hoods, and other sheet-metal parts from GM's strikebound Indianapolis stamping plant by late Thursday night, officials at the plants said. Flint employs about 2,000 workers and builds crew-cab and heavy-duty, full-size pickup trucks, while Moraine employs about 4,000 and builds Chevrolet Blazer and GMC Jimmy compact sport utility vehicles. ""B-crew will come in tonight and that'll be it,"" said George Dunaway, vice president of International Union of Electronics Workers Local 801 in Moraine. Although his union is not involved in the UAW talks, he supports the strikers in Indianapolis and Janesville, Wis. ""A lot of their concerns are our concerns,"" he said. Some states may determine that the laid-off workers won't be eligible for state unemployment benefits because they were idled by a strike. The remainder of the nine GM truck plants fed by Indianapolis are expected to halt operations soon. GM's Shreveport, La., compact pickup truck plant is scheduled to shut down Friday, idling 2,500 workers, and the Linden, N.J. plant, which employs 2,500 and builds both compact pickups and sport utility vehicles, will shut down Friday night. GM's Fort Wayne plant laid off about 2,250 of its 2,600 workers as it halted production of GM's popular full-size Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks Wednesday night. GM's other full-size truck plants in Pontiac, Mich., Oshawa, Ontario, and Silao, Mexico, are expected to follow close behind. The strikes on Tuesday by 2,750 workers at Indianapolis and 4,800 workers in Janesville, Wis., have formed a two-pronged effort to squeeze GM's highly profitable light truck operations, increasing pressure for national and local settlements. The shutdown of the Janesville plant alone could cost GM $50 million a week in pre-tax profits, adding to pressure on the automaker for national and local contract settlements, said David Healy, an auto analyst with Burnham Securities. Meanwhile, other UAW locals sought to join the Indianapolis and Janesville walkouts. GM's Kokomo, Ind., electronics plant requested permission to send about 5,500 workers out on strike. A walkout at that facility would be particularly damaging to GM because it supplies all of the automaker's North American assembly plants with engine electronics, audio systems and other parts. The future of 12 domestic parts plants that GM considers uncompetitive remained a major sticking point in the negotiations. GM wants to exclude several of the plants from union demands that it guarantee employment for 95 percent of UAW workers over the next three years. Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have already granted such guarantees, but GM, the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three automakers, wants changes to the pattern to allow it to cut costs..

"Rested negotiators for General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers met again Friday to make another push for agreement on a new national labour contract before a Saturday meeting of UAW leaders. The bargainers went home without a deal Thursday night after meeting for nearly 32 hours, although some officials said the talks were grinding toward a settlement. The negotiating session on Wednesday and Thursday was the longest since talks began between the automaker and union in June. Bargainers typically meet for long periods just prior to a tentative agreement. ""They're working on trying to resolve the final issues,"" GM spokesman Gerry Holmes said Friday. Talks ""have snagged several times in the past week,"" said Harley Shaiken, a professor of labour relations at the University of California-Berkeley. ""The pressure's been increased considerably by the two plants that are out on strike."" The toll from local strikes in Janesville, Wis., and Indianapolis continued to mount as more plants shut down because of parts shortages. GM's compact sport/utility plant in Moraine, Ohio, halted operations late Thursday night, idling 4,000 workers.

"General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers union reached a tentative agreement early on Saturday for a new national labor contract, ending months of contentious bargaining. ""I think we said back in June that it would be a difficult negotiation, and I think we fulfilled that expectation,"" said a visibly tired GM Chairman Jack Smith. ""Like any negotiation, you never get everything you want."" The three-year deal, which covers 215,000 hourly UAW workers, will not end local strikes that started on Tuesday night in Indiana and Wisconsin, where local grievances remain unresolved, UAW President Stephen Yokich said. He also held out the threat of additional strikes among GM's 123 UAW locals that have not yet reached plant-specific agreements with the automaker. ""I would suggest that the company work hard and get their locals cleaned up,"" Yokich said. ""Quite frankly the two that walked out have a heavy agenda on the table and they have a lot of work."" Yokich declined to say when the agreement would go to rank-and-file members for ratification, but about 250 local leaders from GM plants around the country would meet in Chicago on Wednesday Nov. 6 to consider the pact. Instead of the traditional joint statements and handshakes between company and union officials, Yokich insisted that the two sides hold separate news conferences to announce the agreement shortly after 2 a.m. CST (0700 GMT) Saturday. Details of the agreement were not released, but Gerald Knechtel, vice president of personnel, said it fits within the pattern that the UAW set at Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Corp. Both of those companies agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current hourly workforces. ""The UAW presented its objectives to us and we talked about the objectives that we had and we found a way to address those within the pattern that was so important to the UAW,"" he said, adding that the deal allows GM to make competitive improvements. The talks were said to hit several snags over the past week over several plants that GM wanted to exclude from the 95 percent employment guarantees. Among those were a door hinge plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., that GM has put on the sale block. The proposed exceptions to the pattern were aimed at allowing GM, the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three automakers, to cut costs and boost productivity. Although all three of the companies pay a base wage of about $19 an hour, Ford and Chrysler buy more of their parts from lower-cost outside suppliers than GM does. GM wanted the ability to ""outsource"" more of its parts work. Economic provisions of the GM contract were expected to follow those at Ford and Chrysler, offering workers a $2,000 bonus in the first year of the contract, followed by 3 percent increases in base wages during the second and third years. The deal came as GM's production losses due to strikes at a metal stamping plant in Indianapolis and a truck plant in Janesville, Wis., mounted on Friday. By late Friday, more than 19,000 workers at seven plants were idled, including 2,750 strikers in Indianapolis and 4,800 in Janesville. ",DavidLawder
"General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers union reached a tentative deal for a job-preserving labour contract early Saturday, but the accord failed to halt costly local strikes in Wisconsin and Indiana. The three-year national agreement, which covers wages, benefits and job security for GM's 215,000 hourly UAW workers, did little to resolve contentious plant-specific issues that remain unresolved at most of the carmaker's 123 locals. UAW President Stephen Yokich, announcing the pact at a 2 a.m. EST (0700 GMT) news conference, held out the threat of ""We can't tell you what's going to happen in the other locals,"" Yokich said. ""I would suggest that the company work very hard and get their locals cleaned up."" President Clinton applauded the agreement. ""I am very hopeful that the tentative agreement will be ratified, and that the outstanding local issues will quickly be resolved so that everyone can get back to work,"" he said. On Tuesday night, about 2,750 workers walked off the job at GM's Indianapolis metal stamping plant and 4,800 struck the company's Janesville, Wisconsin, truck assembly plant over local grievances, including demands for more workers to deal with increasing workloads. The strike at Indianapolis cut off supplies of fenders, hoods, roofs and other steel body panels to nine GM North American truck plants. It threatened to paralyse much of GM's highly profitable light truck operations by early next week. On Saturday, more than 19,000 workers at seven GM assembly and components plants were idled because of the two strikes. That comes on top of 18,958 U.S. workers still on layoff status because of lingering parts shortages from a three-week Canadian Auto Workers strike that ended Oct. 23. Analysts estimate the UAW-related shutdowns will cost the carmaker $20 million a day in lost profits, on top of a $350 million loss from the Canadian walkout. But the national UAW accord Saturday appeared to push negotiations in Janesville and Indianapolis forward. ""I think they've intensified their talks a bit,"" said an official at UAW Local 95 in Janesville. UAW Local 292 officials also reported progress in local talks at GM's 5,500-employee Delco Electronics plant in Kokomo, Indiana. On Thursday, the unit sought Yokich's permission to join the other locals on strike. The UAW-GM national agreement will be submitted to rank-and-file members for ratification after about 250 UAW leaders meet to consider the pact on Wednesday in Chicago. The deal was unanimously approved by the union's national GM bargaining council. Details of the pact were not released Saturday, but Gerald Knechtel, GM vice president of personnel, said it fits within the pattern that the UAW set at Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. Both of those companies agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current hourly workforces and will give workers a $2,000 bonus in the first year of the contract, followed by three percent raises in the second and third years of the contract. Knechtel said GM will depend on its UAW workforce to gain efficiencies over the next three years. The company had been seeking the flexibility to shift more work to lower-cost outside suppliers. ""We feel we have the ability to make competitive improvements in the company. We will need to do that with the UAW,"" he said. In a sign that contentious issues remain, company and union officials did not announce the pact in a joint news conference with the traditional handshakes and smiles. Instead, they held made grim-faced separate statements to reporters gathered at GM's Detroit headquarters building.

"Strike-fueled production losses mounted for General Motors Corp. Friday as the United Auto Workers signaled a snag in labor contract talks by canceling a Saturday meeting of plant-level leaders here. The UAW said its 250-member National GM Council was now scheduled to meet Wednesday, Nov. 6, in Chicago if the union reaches a tentative agreement covering 215,000 GM workers in the next few days. Although GM officials declined to rule out an agreement on Friday, the UAW's move was viewed as a negative sign for the talks because it buys more time. The council, made up of local leaders from across the country, must approve any contract deal. Meanwhile, pressure from local strikes in Indiana and Wisconsin mounted Friday as the number of workers idled by the walkouts exceeded 19,000. In a two-pronged effort to deprive GM of profits from its light truck operations, 2,750 workers walked off the job at the company's Indianapolis metal stamping plant and 4,809 struck the Janesville, Wis., truck assembly plant Tuesday. The Indianapolis plant feeds fenders, doors, hoods and other major body panels to nine of GM's 11 North American light truck plants, five of which are now idle, including Janesville. GM's Shreveport, La., compact pickup truck plant shut down Friday, idling 2,400 workers, while GM's Linden, N.J., plant, which employs about 2,500 workers, was expected to run out of parts Friday night.

GM's board of directors on Monday is expected to delay an anticipated increase in the company's quarterly common stock dividend if a deal is not reached soon. The company's quarterly payout rate of 40 cents a share is unchanged since February, despite strong profits.

GM's Shreveport, La., compact pickup truck plant also shut down Friday, idling 2,400 workers, while GM's Linden, N.J., plant, which employs about 2,500 workers, was expected to run out of parts Friday night. Linden produces Chevrolet and GMC compact pickups and sport utility vehicles. About 3,500 workers were idled at GM's Moraine, Ohio, compact sport utility vehicle plant Thursday night, while 2,250 workers were laid off at GM's Fort Wayne, Ind., full-size pickup truck assembly plant on Wednesday night. In addition, 900 workers who build V-8 engines for trucks assembled in Janesville and Fort Wayne were idled on Friday. Michael Ward, an auto analyst at Paine Webber, said the Janesville, Fort Wayne and Moraine shutdowns alone will cost GM $10 million a day in after-tax lost profits. ""We're looking at $10 million a day right now, and that could easily expand to $20 million by Monday,"" Ward said. Full-size pickup truck plants in Flint and Pontiac, Mich., and Oshawa, Ontario, could run out of parts within the next several days, while a GM truck plant in Silao, Mexico, was believed to have a greater supply of parts on hand. Layoffs from the UAW strikes were increasing as GM's U.S. car operations are still staggering from the effects of the three-week Canadian Auto Workers strike, which ended Oct. 23. GM said it still had 18,958 workers idled by continuing shortages of Canadian-made parts at six car assembly plants, six engine and transmission plants and four metal stamping facilities. Lost profits associated with the Canadian walkout are estimated at more than $350 million. ",DavidLawder
"General Motors Corp cut a deal to end a costly strike at an Indianapolis metal stamping plant on Saturday, about 14 hours after it announced a tentative national contract agreement with the United Auto Workers union. The five-day Indianapolis strike had threatened to paralyze most of GM's North American light truck production by early next week. Along with a second, still-unresolved walkout at GM's Janesville, Wisconsin, truck plant, the dispute was responsible for the idling of more than 19,000 workers. But the 2,750 Indianapolis strikers could be back on the job stamping out fenders, doors, hoods and other truck body parts by Sunday night following a ratification vote scheduled for Sunday morning, said Patrick Morrissey, a spokesman for GM's Metal Fabricating Division. However, GM's full-size pickup truck plant in Pontiac, Michigan, may still shut down on Monday due to shortages of Indianapolis-made parts, joining four other idled truck plants and an crippled engine plant. Ronald Gettelfinger, UAW regional director in Indianapolis, said the new local labor agreement, reached at about 6:15 p.m. EST (2315 GMT) on Saturday, was not influenced by the national GM-UAW labor accord, which covers 215,000 U.S. hourly workers. The national contract defines wages, benefits, job security and other broad issues, while local pacts cover plant specific issues like work rules and staffing levels. ""We've got great negotiators at the top,"" Gettelfinger said. ""This was local issues."" He declined to discuss the grievances that sparked the strike. They were believed to include demands for more jobs to cope with an increasing workload and protections for skilled trades workers. UAW President Stephen Yokich, who announced the national pact at a 2 a.m. EST (0700 GMT) news conference, held out the threat of more local strikes to keep GM from dragging its feet in negotiations with its 123 locals. ""We can't tell you what's going to happen in the other locals,"" Yokich said. ""I would suggest that the company work very hard and get their locals cleaned up."" President Bill Clinton applauded UAW-GM agreement on Saturday. ""I am very hopeful that the tentative agreement will be ratified and that the outstanding local issues will quickly be resolved so that everyone can get back to work,"" he said. About 4,800 workers in Janesville remain on strike, although UAW Local 95 officials said local talks intensified on Saturday. The plant, which builds GM's popular Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon sport-utility vehicles, is one of the automaker's most profitable factories. Analysts estimate the UAW-related shutdowns will cost the carmaker up to $20 million a day in lost profits, on top of an estimated $350 million loss from a Canadian walkout that ended on Oct. 23. The UAW-GM national agreement will be submitted to rank-and-file members for ratification after about 250 UAW leaders meet to consider the pact on Wednesday in Chicago. The deal was unanimously approved by the union's national GM bargaining council. Details of the pact were not released on Saturday, but Gerald Knechtel, GM vice president of personnel, said it fits within the pattern that the UAW set at Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Corp Both of those companies agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current hourly workforces and will give workers a $2,000 bonus in the first year of the contract, followed by 3 percent raises in the second and third years of the contract. One union official said the pact maintains the 95 percent job guarantee but allows GM some flexibility to exit certain unprofitable businesses and to allow employment at some factories to fall below that threshold. In a sign that contentious issues remain, company and union officials did not announce the pact in a joint news conference with the traditional handshakes and smiles. Instead, they made grim-faced separate statements to reporters gathered at GM's Detroit headquarters building. ""I think we said back in June that it would be a difficult negotiation, and I think we fulfilled that expectation,"" said a visibly tired GM Chairman Jack Smith. ""Like any negotiation, you never get everything you want."" ",DavidLawder
"Workers at a key General Motors Corp. metal stamping plant in Indianapolis began returning to work on Sunday after ratifying a deal to end a five-day strike that threatened to paralyze most of the automaker's light truck production. But a similar settlement eluded negotiators at GM's Janesville, Wis., truck assembly plant, where a strike over local issues by 4,800 workers entered its sixth day. Janesville, which builds GM's popular Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon sport/utility vehicles, is one of the automaker's most profitable factories. The deal for 2,750 workers in Indianapolis, which came hours after GM and the UAW announced a tentative agrement for a new national labor contract early Saturday morning, calls for the hiring of 200 new workers at the plant. It also leaves seniority rules for skilled trades workers intact and provides thousands of dollars in back pay for workers to settle grievances. ""I regret we did have to call a strike here,"" said UAW regional director Ron Gettlefinger in Indianapolis. ""I'm hoping other General Motors plants I'm responsible for will heed the seriousness of local agreements."" The Indianapolis strike shut off shipments of fenders, doors, hoods and oher steel body panels to nine of GM's North American light truck plants. By the weekend, parts shortages due to the strike had caused GM to shut down truck plants in Fort Wayne, Ind., Shreveport, La., Moraine, Ohio and Linden, N.J. Including the strikers at Janesville and Indianapolis, the UAW walkouts had idled over 19,000 workers, in addition to 18,858 GM workers still on layoff because of lingering parts shortages from a three-week Canadian Auto Workers strike that ended Oct. 23. UAW officials said stamping operations would resume Sunday night, with the plant back to full production by Monday, but that may not prove soon enough to keep other plants from running out of parts, including GM's full-size pickup truck plant in Pontiac, Mich., which employs nearly 6,000 people. Other threatened plants that receive parts from Indianapolis are located in Flint, Mich., Oshawa, Ontario and Silao, Mexico. On Saturday, UAW President Stephen Yokich put GM on notice that some of the automaker's GM's 123 other locals may go on strike over lack of progress in local negotiations. A clearer picture of the UAW-GM national agreement, which covers some 215,000 U.S. hourly workers, began to emerge Sunday. The contract meets the pattern set by Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. on most major issues, including a guarantee that GM will maintain jobs for 95 percent of its current hourly work force. But the pact contains exceptions that will allow GM to sell some unprofitable parts plants, including a door hinge plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich. On economics, the pact gives wokers a $2,000 bonus in the first year of the contract, followed by 3 percent raises in the second and third years of the contract. It also provides generous gains in pension benefits, including the elimination of a cap on outside earnings for retirees, which is viewed as a major incentive for older workers to leave the company. Like Ford and Chrysler, GM will be able to pay workers in new auto parts businesses that it enters a lower wage than the standard $19 an hour paid by the Big Three. GM has been trying to shed parts businesses as it tries to catch up to Chrysler's and Ford's efficiency levels. But analysts say the pact could slow GM's progress in trying to shrink its work force through attrition. ""GM is not going to get the competitive lift from labor in this contract,"" said Eugene Jennings, a retired Michigan State University professor of management who is close to Detroit's Big Three automakers. ""They have to find  enough efficiencies to support excess labor."" ",DavidLawder
"Investors pushed General Motors Corp. shares higher Monday, a sign that Wall Street is pleased that the auto giant signed a new national labour agreement that allows it to shed some workers. GM's shares traded up $1.50 at $55.50 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange after the company signed the tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers union early Saturday morning. ""The Wall Street reaction reflects some belief that GM didn't cave in,"" said Burnham Securities auto analyst David Healy. ""GM appears to have retained its right to manage and indulge in some outsourcing."" Analysts said the pact will allow GM to reduce its 215,000-member hourly work force by 30,000 or more during the next three years through normal retirements. The pact contains a nominal guarantee that GM maintain employment of about 95 percent of its current work force -- a pattern set in the Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. agreements -- but it also allows GM to exit some unprofitable parts businesses and sell certain components plants. David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation, said he believes the pact will help GM to to boost efficiency. ""GM can use attrition to shrink its work force and take advantage of productivity improvements,"" Cole said. ""The UAW has as much interest in a competitive General Motors as the shareholders do."" But the positive reaction was tempered by a continuing strike at GM's Janesville, Wis., truck assembly plant, where 4,809 workers walked off the job Oct. 29 over demands for more jobs. The plant makes the Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon sport/utilities, which are among GM's most popular -- and most profitable -- vehicles. UAW Local 95 wants GM to hire more workers in Janesville to reduce the strain of heavy overtime and an increasing workload. On Sunday, members of UAW Local 23 returned to work at a key metal stamping plant in Indianapolis after ratifying a settlement on a new local contract. The union members had struck for five days, shutting off shipments of fenders, doors, hoods and other steel body panels to nine of GM's 11 North American light truck assembly plants. By the weekend, strike-caused parts shortages forced GM to shut down factories in Fort Wayne, Ind., Shreveport, La., Moraine, Ohio, and Linden, N.J. GM said the Fort Wayne and Moraine plants are scheduled to resume normal operations Tuesday, while Shreveport and Linden will be running again by Thursday. Last week, the UAW walkouts and lingering parts shortages from last month's Canadian Auto Workers strike had idled nearly 38,000 GM workers in the United States. GM did not say how many workers were still idle, but added that four car plants stricken by the CAW strike will be back to full production by Tuesday, including Detroit; Lordstown, Ohio; and Lake Orion and Lansing, Mich. Healy estimated that between the two walkouts, GM's production losses will total 175,000 cars and trucks, which will slash the company's fourth-quarter profits by $600 million to $650 million. In contrast to the tense atmosphere that continues to surround the GM labour situation, UAW President Stephen Yokich and Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton signed a new three-year contract in an historic ceremony at the union's Detroit headquarters. The signing marked the first time that a Big Three automaker has signed a new labour accord at the UAW's Solidarity House. Yokich and Eaton were in a jovial mood as they signed the pact -- a stark contrast to the separate, grim-faced news conferences where the UAW and GM announced their deal early Saturday morning. Yokich told reporters the Chrysler signing ""shows that this company recognises the union and wants to work with them."" Meanwhile, GM declared an unchanged quarterly dividend of 40 cents a share on its $1-2/3 par value common stock. Some analysts had expected GM's board of directors to increase the annual payout to $2 a share from $1.60 because of its growing cash pile. But Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi said the board did not want to disrupt the UAW pact's ratification by giving more cash to shareholders. ",DavidLawder

But the pact contains exceptions that will allow GM to sell some unprofitable parts plants, including a door hinge plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich. The pact also is believed to contain complicated formulas that allow GM to shrink employment in certain businesses as workers retire. ""On the surface, it looks as though as it ought to be viewed by the investor community in a positive light."" said Lehman Brothers auto analyst Joseph Phillippi. ""GM's primary focus was to gain the ability to ride the attrition curve."" On economics, the pact gives wokers a $2,000 bonus in the first year of the contract, followed by 2 percent raises in the second and third years of the contract. It also provides generous gains in pension benefits, including the elimination of a cap on outside earnings for retirees, which is viewed as a major incentive for older workers to leave the company.

"General Motors Corp. Tuesday  reached a tentative deal to end a week-long strike at its truck plant in Janesville, Wis., the last of a recent wave of local walkouts against the automaker. About 4,809 members of United Auto Workers Local 95 were scheduled to vote on the tentative local labor agreement at a 1 p.m. EST Wednesday meeting. Production of Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and GMC Yukon full-size sport-utility vehicles at the Janesvillle plant could resume shortly thereafter if the deal is ratified, said GM spokesman Thomas Beaman. The trucks are among GM's most popular and profitable vehicles. The resumption would mean that by Thursday, all of GM's North American car and truck operations would be operating normally for the first time since Oct. 3, when about 26,000 members of the Canadian Auto Workers went on strike. GM was still reeling from the Canadian strike when workers at Janesville and GM's Indianapolis metal stamping plant walked off the job last week. By last weekend, the auto giant had nearly 40,000 U.S. workers idled by the two local UAW strikes and lingering Canadian parts shortages. However, the UAW has threatened GM with additional local walkouts if the automaker drags its feet in plant-specific negotiations with the rest of its 123 locals. Neither GM nor officials for Local 95 would discuss details of the agreement. The union's members walked off the job Oct. 29 over plant-specific issues, including demands for more workers to ease the burdens of heavy overtime and an increasing production rate. ""We're confident we've got a fair and equitable agreement for our membership,"" said Buford Beleau, a spokesman for Local 95 in Janesville. ""We just want to get back to work building trucks and provide for our families, like everybody else."" To settle the Indianapolis strike, GM agreed to hire 200 more workers, pay thousands of dollars in back pay to workers and drop plans to change job classifications for skilled trades workers. GM truck plants in Shreveport, La., and Linden, N.J., which were shut down by a lack of fenders, doors, and other steel body panels from Indianapolis, will be back to their normal work schedules by Thursday. But the automaker's Wentzville, Mo., plants which halted one of two production shifts because of the Canadian strike, will keep 1,100 workers on temporary layoff for nearly two more weeks. The extended layoff is aimed at reducing dealer inventories of GM's all-new, full-size vans, Beaman said. Despite an all-new design for 1997 and a complete renovation of the Wentzville factory, he said the new Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana were falling victim to lower demand for all full-size vans. Also on Wednesday, about 250 UAW local leaders from plants around the country will meet in Chicago to review details of the union's tentative, three year national contract with GM. They must approve the pact to send it to GM's 215,000 U.S. hourly workers for ratification. The contract is expected to give GM flexibility to exit some unprofitable parts businesses and reduce its workforce through attrition and early retirements, while nominally guaranteeing that the automaker will maintain hourly employment at 95 percent of its current level. The 95 percent job guarantee was a cornerstone of the UAW's contracts with Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., which also offered workers a $2,000 bonus in the first year of the pact, follwed by 3 percent raises in the second and third years.

"General Motors Corp. can shrink its workforce under a United Auto Workers pact that differs significantly from contracts with Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., the union disclosed Wednesday. But the three-year GM agreement also contains tougher restrictions on using outside companies for parts, aimed at curbing job losses to lower-cost outside suppliers. Following a unanimous approval by about 250 plant-level leaders gathered here Wednesday, GM's 215,000 rank-and-file UAW members are expected to ratify the pact by Nov. 17. Despite the differences, most local officials said they were pleased with the pact. ""This agreement definitely sells itself,"" said Duane Zuckschwerdt, president of UAW Local 659 in Flint, Mich. ""I don't foresee a problem with ratification."" In documents distributed to the leaders, the union said the contract calls for GM to follow Ford and Chrysler in maintaining employment at 95 percent of current levels, but contains certain key exceptions. The pact allows GM to halt replacements of retiring workers when it makes efficiency gains in its factories -- a point that will be especially helpful to the automaker as it introduces new cars and trucks that can be built with fewer workers over the next several years. Another provision allows GM to adjust workforces in plants and business lines located in larger geographic groupings than at Ford and Chrysler. For example, GM's 13 factories in Flint, Mich., which employ nearly 28,000 workers, constitute a single grouping. As such, GM does not have to guarantee 95 percent of the jobs in each facility, only 95 percent of the total, which would allow the automaker to exit certain uncompetitive businesses. Some plants in the Flint grouping remain at risk. GM's V-8 engine plant there is still scheduled to close in the third quarter of 1999, and the contract did not address the future of the Buick City assembly plant, which has been assigned no new product beyond the 1999 model year. UAW officials say they hope to persuade GM to commit to new products to those plants. GM wants to exit such labor-intensive businesses such as ""cut-and-sew"" interior trim operations because it maintains it cannot be competitive at base wage rates that will reach $21.59 an hour for the average assembly and parts worker by the end of the contract. Including benefits, GM's hourly labor costs exceed $43 per worker. GM is currently negotiating to sell an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., and a door hinge plant in Flint, but UAW Vice President Richard Shoemaker said the contract gives no consent to the sale and does not exclude any other plants. ""We have not agreed they can sell those plants,"" he said. ""If they do sell them, there isn't any question that they're covered by the GM national agreement."" However, Jim Macbride, a UAW international representative, warned that Livonia is among several plants that may wage local strikes against GM. ""There's going to be a line in the sand drawn somewhere,"" he said. Workers at GM's Janesville, Wis., truck plant began returning to work on Wednesday after a ratifying a deal to end a week-long strike. Most of GM's 123 locals are still in contentious negotiations over local agreements. To help cushion the blow for workers that may be idled by productivity improvements and discontinued businesses, the UAW said GM has pledged to spend up to $3.75 billion to pay idled workers -- a $400 million increase over the company's committment under the previous contract. Chrysler agreed to increase its income security committment by $200 million to a total of $551 million, while Ford did not add to its $1.156 billion income security fund. GM faces more stringent outsourcing restrictions than Ford and Chrysler do. For example, when GM is contemplating a decision to put a product up for bid by outside firms, it must notify the union sooner in the process. If GM selects an outside supplier to make the part, it must give the UAW at least 30 additional days to match the supplier bid. And the company also will now povide the union with a quarterly master list of parts made by outside firms. Most other provisions in the agreement are identical to the Ford and Chrysler contracts. The pact calls for workers to receive $2,000 in the first year, followed by base wage increases of 3 percent in the second and third years. The pact also includes a 13 percent increase in pension payments for workers under 62 with 30 years of service who retire during the agreement. Elimination of a cap on outside income earned by retirees is viewed as an incentive for older workers to retire. ",DavidLawder
"Imperial Tobacco Group will split from conglomerate Hanson Plc on Oct. 1 as one of the most efficient players in its sector, but while its new chief talks of export-led growth, the outlook is clouded by the threat of litigation against tobacco firms. Imperial is Britain's second-biggest tobacco firm after B.A.T Industries. Its brands include Embassy, John Player Special and Superkings cigarettes as well as Panama and Castella cigars. It is one of four arms of the mighty Hanson conglomerate being spun off into separate companies. In the 10 years since Hanson took over Imperial, it has slashed costs, cut its brands to 33 from 150 and raised productivity by 195 percent. Its 1995 profits were 348 million pounds ($538.9 million) on 3.6 billion ($5.6 billion) of sales. But analysts fear that despite Imperial's impressive track record, its shares could face a rough ride once listed in London. This week saw tobacco stocks hit by a backlash in the United States, with fresh litigation plus tough new curbs from President Clinton to regulate the industry. So far, BAT Industries has borne the brunt. But some analysts believe it is only a matter of time before the U.S. scenario widens its impact and is repeated across the Atlantic. ""If it happens in the United States, it's subsequently followed in other countries,"" said Zafar Khan, analyst at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull. ""Imperial could have been a ripe international takeover candidate. But the litigation threat means a group buying a tobacco company would have a tough time selling the idea to shareholders now,"" he said. UBS analysts agree that the threat of legal action is enough to dampen the company's outlook. But they warn of another possible dampener on the stock when Imperial starts trading -- its heavy reliance on Britain, largely seen as a mature market. Britain accounts for 87 percent of profits, say analysts. Imperial has already committed itself to overseas expansion, but there are fears it will have a tough time muscling in on the U.S. giants, which have already made inroads into the markets of tomorrow - India, China and the Far East. Gareth Davis, Imperial's chief executive, told the London-based Evening Standard newspaper earlier this week that he believed the group would continue to build up exports to Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.

""We see investor concerns on litigation risk combined with the uncertain outlook in the key UK market as implying a 20-30 percent PE (price earnings) discount to the UK average."" This assumes a prospective PE of 9.9 times, UBS said in a note. It has given Hanson a total break-up value of 164 pence, in a market range of 150 to 200 pence per share. Hanson shares were down 2 1/2 pence at 159 1/2 by 1033 GMT Friday. UBS specifically values the Imperial constituent at 39 pence per share or 2.03 billion pounds ($3.14 billion). However, another investment analyst who declined to be named, said he was more upbeat on Imperial's prospects. ""It's a clean business. It could become a takeover target and it's also very cash generative,"" he said. He values Imperial at 37 pence in a total Hanson break-up valuation of 187 pence per share. There is some upside to the Imperial story. Apart from being viewed as a highly efficient player and being the second biggest UK tobacco company with 38 percent of the market, it is also poised to try and tap the vast emerging markets. Gareth Davis (corrects from Nigel Davis), Imperial's chief executive who joined the company straight from university, told the London-based Evening Standard newspaper earlier this week that he believed the group would continue to build up exports to Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.

"Two of the biggest names in the British motor industry, Rover and Vauxhall, kicked off the British International Motor Show on Tuesday by unveiling big new investments to fuel their drive for more exports. Rover, owned by Germany's BMW, said it planned to launch a new four-wheel drive ""baby Land Rover"" to take on Japanese rivals in Britain and world export markets. The new vehicle, due to go on sale in 1998, is part of Rover's rolling 3.0 billion pound ($4.75 billion) investment programme. Rover will in addition inject 3.5 billion pounds of new business into the components industry. This will go mainly to British firms and safeguard tens of thousands of jobs at Rover and its supplier firms. Vauxhall, owned by General Motors of the United States.S., also guaranteed 4,200 existing jobs at its Ellesmere Port complex in northwest England with the announcement of a 300 million pound investment to modernise the plant. Efforts by both companies to gear up to expand foreign sales come as the British market is witnessing sluggish sales, with most growth stemming from sales to company car fleets. The Birmingham-based motor show, following the recent Paris showcase, saw motor companies banging the sales drum, seeking to gloss over their problems with glitz and new gizmos to tempt customers into buying. But exports remain key. Rover's new chief executive, Dr Walter Hasselkus, said: ""The baby Land Rover is very much an export product,"" adding that he hoped its export sales would account for 70 percent of production and boost sales in 1998. Vauxhall Motors chairman and managing director Nick Reilly said while the British and European markets remained difficult, he saw opportunities for sales of the five-year old Astra model to grow quite significantly in Asia Pacific and Latin America. Most industry leaders agree that Europe is likely to remain a cut-throat place to do business, with over-capacity squeezing margins. Ian McAllister, head of Ford Motors in Britain, told Reuters that the six percent growth levels seen in Europe was distorted by factors like discounting and the French government offering incentives for customers to buy new cars. Some analysts put underlying European growth as low as two percent, after stripping out factors like those cited by Ford. McAllister blamed poor consumer interest in Britain on the ""feeling-not-so-good"" factor and predicted no turnaround until consumers were cured of their recessionary hangover.

"Ford Motor Company Ltd, the U.S. carmaker's U.K. arm, said on Tuesday that the British sales outlook for 1997 looked pretty flat as customers suffered from a ""feeling-not-so-good"" factor. Ian McAllister, chairman and managing director of Ford U.K., told Reuters in an interview at the British International Motor Show that weak sentiment was the primary reason for sluggish interest among UK consumers in the last three years. ""People were badly bitten by the recession and have become cautious about their own personal balance sheets,"" he said. He added that it would require an end to consumer worries, like house owners' negative equity, and a cure for the recessionary hangover before the private car market took off. Industry analysts have said that most of the growth in the UK car market has been due to companies buying cars, rather than the man on the street snapping up new models. McAllister said company fleet sales would remain a priority for Ford in the coming year but said, ""We will reduce our exposure to the heavily discounted rental market."" The UK chief agreed that the slight growth in sales across the wider European car market so far in 1996 had been distorted by government incentives in countries like France to trade in fuel guzzling old cars for new models, as well as heavy discounting by most car makers. The underlying picture for the European car industry has been less promising, he acknowleged, agreeing that excess market capacity in Europe had fuelled downward pressure on margins for players across the board. -- London newsroom +44 171 542 7717 ",EdnaFernandes
"Wickes Plc, the British Do-It-Yourself retailer rocked by accounting irregularities this summer, said on Wednesday the first cost was a 51 million pounds ($80.84 million) write-off for which its ex-chairman accepted responsibility. The retailer said the problems had resulted in profits being overstated by 51 million pounds ($80.8 million) over recent years and that amount will be wiped off shareholder funds. The restatement of the accounts will result in a reduction of 26 million pounds in operating profit for 1995, 14 million pounds for 1994 and 11 million pounds for earlier years. Profits for 1995 will also be hit by a two million pounds charge against shareholder funds relating to European businesses and a 10 million pounds charge stemming from property interests. But the cost does not end there. Finance director Bill Hoskins, brought in after the purge which saw former chairman and chief executive Henry Sweetbaum resign, told Reuters he expected another one-off charge against 1996 results. This relates to restructuring and the costs of the investigation into the accounting problems uncovered in June. Hoskins told Reuters: ""Taking the two together, the cost won't be tens of millions, but around 10 million."" The company will now undergo a refinancing rights issue. Hoskin said 30 million pounds would be ""a good starting point"" and be used to cut gearing (the debt-to-equity ratio) which remains ""pretty horrid."" The new chairman Michael von Brentano said in a letter to shareholders his predecessor Sweetbaum accepted ""ultimate responsibility"" and would repay his 1.2 million pounds in bonus payments including tax. Former finance director Trefor Llewellyn has agreed to repay his 485,000 pounds bonus for 1995. The group is seeking a new chief executive and said it also intends to strengthen non-executive representation on its board. Disciplinary action has been taken against two Wickes directors with responsibility for the buying department, both of whom have resigned. Further action against other middle ranking executives and more junior employees will be taken in due course, the company said. Wickes will replace auditors Arthur Andersen once the work is completed on revisions, but it reserved the right to take action against it. ""I appreciate that much of what I have written will be very disappointing to you,"" von Brentano's letter said. ""But now my principal concern is to secure the company's future, define the appropriate cost base and reassert the group's market strengths,"" he said. Hoskins also spoke of a new start, telling Reuters ""We want to make a clear distinction between the past and the future. It is essential that we draw a line in the sand."" But the path to profitability still looks rocky. Nick Bubb, analyst at MeesPierson said there were two disappointments: ""The company is losing money this year, admittedly partly because of large exceptional items, and the fact that the debt is as high as it is at 65 million pounds - that is a big increase and I can see why a rights issue is needed."" But he added that 30 million pounds was seen as the bare minimum. This would cut gearing to just 70 percent. ""It may need to raise as much as 40 or 50 million and that won't be easy,"" said Bubb. Wickes shares remain suspended at 69 pence, frozen at that level since the problems were uncovered in June. They will not resume trading until early 1997. ($1=.6309 Pound) ",EdnaFernandes

In a letter to shareholders, new chairman Michael von Brentano said the group had recorded an operating loss for the nine months so far this year but pledged that its objective was a return to profits in 1997. ""A new business plan...will be finalised once the negotiations with suppliers are substantially complete. This provides for a substantial reduction in costs, improved marketing initiatives and efficient administrative procedures,"" he said. Wickes also plans a refinancing involving a rights issue of new shares to restore its gearing to a ""more suitable level"". Group net debt averaged 65 million in the second half of the year. Wickes said it would not seek a relisting of its shares, which were suspended in June, until the new rights shares were issued. A prospectus in connection with the issue was expected to be issued in December, with the new shares being issued following shareholder approval in early 1997.

"Wickes Plc, the Do-It-Yourself retailer hit by accounting discrepencies dating back five years, told Reuters on Wednesday it planned another one-off charge against 1996 results of around 10 million stg.

Finance director Bill Hoskins told Reuters in an interview: ""Taking the two together, the cost won't be tens of millions, but around 10 million."" He also said that under plans for a rights issue 30 million stg would be ""a good starting point.""   The charge cited by the finance chief will be in addition to charges announced by the chairman Michael von Brentano earlier on Wednesday. Von Brentano had said there would be a 51 million stg write-off against shareholder funds to cover the profit overstatements for recent years, due to misleading accounting. There is also a separate 10 million stg charge relating to property interests. Wickes said it planned to explore all avenues to boost its finances before going to shareholders, with a 30 million cash call seen as possible.   Details of the refinancing are due in December, said Wickes, when it will reveal more about how it plans to turn the group round to profitability by 1997. Hoskins described the current level of gearing as ""pretty horrid."" Net debt has averaged at 65 million in the second half. Talking about the timetable for change, he said ""Hopefully the plans will be approved in January and the share relisting will be in early 1997."" Shares are currently suspended, frozen at 69 pence.

Hoskins concluded that the company wanted to make a clean break from its past troubles. ""We want to make a clear distinction between the past and the future. It is essential that we draw a line in the sand and where we have to face up to our responsibilities we will."" The chairman told Reuters ""We're in negotiations with all our suppliers and we hope our negotiations will be concluded by the end of the month."" He added that next year would start with a clean slate, with no more charges expected. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717 ",EdnaFernandes
"Japanese car giant Nissan Motor Co is expected to make a decision on whether to go ahead with building a new medium-sized vehicle for the European market in spring 1997, according to the head of its UK operations. Ian Gibson, managing director of Nissan Motor UK and vice-president of Nissan Europe, said in an interview with Reuters he would be presenting his plan to the Nissan board in Tokyo next spring. But he added that the investment size, design details and production were yet to be thrashed out. Gibson said it was still an open verdict on whether the plan would go ahead. Speaking from the British Internaitonal Motor Show in Birmingham, he said the new car would be between its small Micra and larger Primera, based on the Almeira model which is currently manufactured in Japan and shipped to Europe. ""If we build the car in Europe, the design and develoment is purely for a model destined for Europe, not one that has to include a number of viewpoints for world export."" ""We will do it from scratch if it goes ahead,"" said Gibson. But he added that if the decision is given the go-ahead next year it would mean moving up to 100,000 units of capacity from Japan into Europe. ""The question is what opportunities are there for Japan to use that excess capacity for something else?"" Gibson said this was part of the equation in the decision but refused to outline what options the Japan headquarters were looking at in terms of ""new models and new markets."" If Nissan does decide to build the new model in Europe it would be manufactured in the UK or Spain. Gibson was circumspect about the cost of developing and putting the new model on sale, saying ""I can't see it happening for less than 200 million (stg). But that's the absolute minimum. He refused to cite a top end figure, but separately spoke of the general industry cost of building and marketing a new vehicle, estimating it at between one and three billion stg. On Nissan's European sales for 1996, Gibson said there would be a modest rise, predicting three percent sales growth for 1997. ",EdnaFernandes
"British building group AMEC Plc said on Friday it was exploring a possible investment in France's Spie Batignolle's electrical and construction businesses with the aim of widening its international exposure. AMEC said it had been in talks with Spie management about taking an unquantified minority stake which could be raised to a majority stake from the current parent group Schneider SA. If clinched, the deal would create a major European player with around five billion pounds ($7.9 billion) in sales, with 40 percent exposure in Britain, 30 percent in France and the rest worldwide. Peter Mason, AMEC's chief executive, told Reuters: ""One important concept is that there is little overlap between the two groups."" He admitted that AMEC's possible greater exposure to France came as the market was suffering from very tough conditions but he said that AMEC was ""buying at the bottom, not at the top"" and foresaw a turnaround. The new deal could act as a springboard for AMEC into new markets including oil and gas and pharmaceuticals and new regions including Indonesia, Latin America and South Africa, Mason said. At present 70 percent of its sales are in Britain. Mason told Reuters that the two parties were at the due diligence stage and expected more details by November, with completion in December. The initial stake will be funded from AMEC's existing cash reserves and will give it access to Spie's international network of regional bases offering partnership opportunities on a cost-efficient basis. The decision to raise the stake to a majority holding would be taken in ""a number of years' time and I'm not talking one or two years"". AMEC and Spie management envisage a possible flotation of the French operation. ""There will be negotiations between the management and us on how much we will retain and what to float. It will also depend on the state of the (stock) market at the time,"" the AMEC chief said. ""I have been most impressed with Spie's management team and the progress they have made in revitalising Spie,"" he added. Spie has 28,000 employees and operates in 290 locations. In its 1995 results after restructuring it reported turnover of 17 billion francs ($3.26 billion) and an operating profit of 34 million francs.

"UK building bosses and health insiders have warned of dying confidence in privately financed health projects, unless there is rapid acceleration in the number of contracts awarded in the next few months. This industry crisis of confidence comes ahead of Monday's annual Private Finance Panel conference on Monday, which will be addressed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and health secretary Stephen Dorrell.   This week the government provided a glimmer of hope, however, giving the go-ahead to a 280 million pounds east London hospital project won by a venture led by AMEC Plc. But of all the problems in the Conservative government's flagship private finance initiative (PFI) -- aimed at attracting private sector cash for public infrastructure projects -- health has proved to be the biggest headache of all. The Treasury set Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell a target of 500 million pounds of projects by April.   The likelihood of that target being reached looked slim until this week, when the government sought to temporarily silence its critics with its announcement of the first major private finance health project -- the east London hospital. Before that, building firms and National Health Service (NHS) leaders had been apportioning blame for delays on each other and the government as it tried to referee both sides. British junior health minister John Horam defended his department's record in a recent interview with Reuters.   ""We are confident of getting 500 million pounds by April. If we are able to bring in a 170 million project and a 30 million one in the next few months then we are almost there,"" he said. But some construction industry leaders remain downbeat, privately hinting the biggest players in the business will shun future projects for fear of tying up further millions in a sector which is taking too long to deliver the goods. ""I've heard that around 20 companies are not going to go forward with new bids,"" one industry leader said. Also, some leading National Health Service (NHS) figures have questioned the value of the policy itself.   Gordon Best, a leading adviser to chief executives of NHS Trusts told Reuters the policy was ""a dead duck"" in health and said the government would have to push one or two schemes through just to ""save face."" He said PFI had resulted in projects which the NHS could not afford and failed its needs. Another construction industry leader summed up the crisis of confidence among builders: ""Companies are frustrated with the whole negotiating approach -- I wouldn't say it should be abandoned but the whole process needs radical surgery."" Graham Watts, chief executive of the Construction Industry Council was also pessimistic.   ""The big companies have basically had enough. They've spent a lot of money so far and there is resentment that they're being used to pioneer a system which is not working at a time when an industry is still locked in recession."" PFI has been very slow getting off the ground, both due to red tape and having the Treasury as an ""out-of-the-room negotiator' for many of the projects, industry sources said. Business has been feeding through in other sectors like roads and prisons, but health has proved slow to take off.   One positive factor is that PFI does have the backing of the opposition Labour Party, so industry figures are talking to Labour about their problems. A general election is due by May 1997, with Labour currently leading in opinion polls. In the meantime, the health sector problems remain. Another issue dogging confidence in the building sector is the fear that building firms could be saddled with liabilities if an NHS Trust defaults on repayments over the 30-year term. But minister Horam told Reuters the government had changed the law to underwrite that risk. ""This is one reason why these projects have taken so long. We got Royal Assent on this in June and it makes that commitment inescapable."" He dimissed claims of disillusion: ""The big boys are competing in PFI. No single project has been left without a bidder."" -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717 ",EdnaFernandes
"AMEC Plc, the British building group, said late on Friday that expected to issue details of its possible investment in France's Spie Batignolle by November, predicting it would be wrapped up by the end of the year. Peter Mason, chief executive, said an envisaged initial stake would probably be followed by a decision to take on a larger controlling share ""in a number of years time, and I'm not talking one or two years."" Spie Batignolles is a currently a unit of holding company Schneider SA.   That would be followed by a decision on whether to float part of it off. The amount to be floated would depend on various factors, he said. ""There will be negotiations between the management and us on how much we will retain and what to float. It will also depend on the state of the (stock) market at the time,"" said AMEC's chief executive. He said the deal had been under discussion for some months and represented a good fit. An eventual combined group would have 5.0 billion stg of sales and give AMEC access to key new markets in areas like oil and gas and pharmaceuticals.   It will also act as a springboard for AMEC into new regions, notably Indonesia, South America and South Africa. ""At present 70 percent of our business is in the UK,"" said Mason. But the new deal will mean that the combined group has 40 percent U.K. exposure, 30 percent French exposure with the remainder in world sales. ""One important concept is that there is little overlap between the two groups,"" Mason added. He admitted that the greater exposure to France came as the market was suffering from very tough conditions, but he said that AMEC was ""buying at the bottom, not at the top.""

"Wolseley Plc, the British building materials giant, is seen reporting slightly lower year pretax profits next Tuesday as expected, but reporting a rise in its dividend payout. Wolseley was one of many in the sector to issue a profit warning earlier this year when it said that year profits for the period to July 31 would not match 1995.   But the group is seen turning in a more solid performance for the year than rivals including Redland Plc and RMC Group Plc who have been hit by their heavy exposure to the German market. Analysts forecasts for Wolseley's year profits ranged from 230 million stg to 240 million, with an average prediction of 234.9 million against 245.4 million last year. The dividend is expected to come out between 10.3 pence and 10.5 pence, with analysts predicting an average payout of 10.3 pence against 9.8 pence last year.   A key reason for its relatively better performance compared to sector rivals is that that 50 percent of Wolseley's revenues stemmed from the U.S. market, an analyst said. ""The U.S. may have its regional differences but nationally the economy is doing well,"" he said. He added, however, that the UK market remained difficult and France continued to be ""dreadful."" France is expected to continue to be difficult, while in the UK a recent uptick in the housing market may have fed through to materials firms -- but this remains to be seen.   With a recent changeover of top management, market watchers will also be looking for evidence of any tinkering with the group strategy. Wolseley's existing strategy is seen as sound and analysts may be perturbed if there is evidence of it being radically altered, said one. No exceptionals are anticipated in the results. --Edna Fernandes, London newsroom +44 171 5427717 ",EdnaFernandes
"British building materials company Wolseley Plc reported a one percent slip in year pretax profits on Tuesday, but despite topping analysts' forecasts in a tough market shares slid on the poor outlook for mainland Europe. Pretax profits for the year ended July 31 fell to 242.9 million pounds ($387 million) from 245.4 million. But sales rose to 4.31 billion from 3.78 billion pounds and the dividend was raised to 10.35 pence from 9.80 last year. The fallback in profits had been flagged in a profit warning earlier this year. But Wolseley survived the difficult conditions better than others partly thanks to its lower European exposure. The group has 50 percent of its sales in the U.S. Chairman Richard Ireland reported organic sales growth across all three divisions blaming the lower profits on ""poor economic conditions in mainland Europe and volatile lumber prices in the U.S."" ""The results for 1996 should be set against the background of economic difficulties in France and Austria and a flat home (UK) market,"" he said. But in an interview with Reuters chief financial controller Stephen Webster said ""I do not see an upturn in the next 12 months in France, Austria or Germany."" He denied it would seriously dampen profits this coming year, explaining that conditions remain stable. The UK market showed a glimmer of recovery, with spending on repair and maintenance of homes moving ahead. But Webster said the housebuilding sector had seen companies using up existing stock so there has been little feed-through to companies like Wolseley. He predicted it would be spring before the industry felt the benefits. The finance chief also expressed concern about the threat of an interest rate hike in the U.S. ""A half a percent would not be a big deal but one percent could damage confidence."" The caution in all its markets was enough to push shares lower. By 1045 GMT they were down 13 pence at 494. The new chief executive John Young did not signal any departure from the group's existing strategy. But Webster signalled the possibility of some change ""We are keen to keep the good things. If anything it may mean a change of style. ""But there are no sacred cows in Wolseley. We will take difficult decisions if needed."" Young said in the interim statement he wanted to look to expansion into new regions and products.

"Britain's second biggest bus company Cowie Group said on Thursday it had been approached by a defence vehicle manufacturer about forming a leasing joint venture targeting clients including the Ministry of Defence. Cowie told Reuters that the tentative approach was made this year and added it was open to considering new options for business. But the bus and vehicle leasing giant played down a report by The Times newspaper which said the firm was pitching specifically to buy and lease battle tanks, saying such a move was ""highly speculative at this stage."" Cowie conceded, however, that it had received an approach to form a leasing venture for military transportation equipment. Robert Blower, a Cowie spokesman, told Reuters: ""A UK defence equipment supplier has approached us. Their idea was for Cowie to come in as player in the consortium, with our leasing expertise. We will assess each new idea on its merit."" He said any move into military vehicles would have to be cleared with shareholders first, ""...for ethical as well as commercial reasons,"" he said. On the subject of leasing out frontline tanks, Cowie was more cautious, admitting that there had been ""No talks with the MOD. But it has said that under PFI (private finance initiative) there aren't any no-go areas,"" said Blower. The PFI scheme, applied across all government departments, aims to bring private cash into public spending projects including the option of the government leasing equipment. But an MOD spokesman was highly sceptical. Asked whether the MOD would put out a PFI project for tank leasing, he said ""Emphatically not. In broad terms the PFI rules nothing out and nothing in. Cowie has won a contract (with us) for forklift trucks and that is not. There is nothing else on the cards, let alone tanks."" Cowie announced on Wednesday it had won a material handling equipment leasing contract with the MOD. Tank and transportation equipment manufacturers like Vickers Plc were sceptical about reports of expanding leasing to military vehicles. A Vickers spokeswoman told Reuters it did not approach Cowie and described the idea of leasing battle tanks as ""fairly off the wall. Leasing trucks is one things, but a battle tank is quite another,"" she said. But GKN was more circumspect. Asked whether it had approached anyone about the idea of forming a leasing venture to supply the MOD or other markets, a spokeswoman said ""There are no discussions at this stage."" U.S. giants have already caught onto the concept, with world leaders like Lockheed Martin and McDonald Douglas exploring the possibility of leasing military aircraft to Eastern European countries.

"Millennium Chemicals, to be spun off from the mighty Hanson conglomerate in an October flotation, has already had to rebuff would-be suitors, chief executive of the soon-to-be independent company said on Tuesday. William Landuyt, who is also chairman of Millennium, also unveiled his strategic blueprint in an interview with Reuters, including plans for a share buyback by 2000 after cutting debt and implementing post-demerger investment plans. Millennium had 1995 sales of two billion pounds ($3.12 billion) and profits of 588 million pounds. ""We are not a dividend yield stock. We are a growth company,"" Landuyt said, warning investors of a tight dividend policy. The demerger of Hanson Plc will create four companies - Millennium, Imperial Tobacco, Energy Group and the rump building firm which will retain the famous Hanson name. As investors await details of the float of the first two divisions - Millennium and Imperial - Landuyt said there had been takeover interest in all four companies including his own empire. ""We've had interest for every business in Hanson."" He said ""expressions of interest"" included those for whole divisions as well as individual companies within each of the four divisions to be floated off. Millennium itself received approaches for all three of its units - Quantum, SCM and Glidco. All approaches were rebuffed. Hanson's chemicals arm had been widely tipped as a takeover candidate by analysts in recent months, but Hanson's group share price recently took a hit after it was revealed that Millennium had built in a ""poison pill"" to deter predators. The move led to a downgrading in the Hanson break-up value by analysts including BZW which pared back to 193 from 207 pence per share. The market valuation range spreads from 150 pence to 200 pence per share. Hanson's shares stand at 162 1/4, up 2 3/4 pence. One analyst said of the poison pill episode ""It was quite disgusting. Here is a predatory company which has spoken out against such tactics and has installed a poison pill itself."" But Landuyt said it was vital to prevent a predator buying up shares on the cheap and launching an undervalued bid. ""We do expect selling pressure (for Millennium shares) for at least the first six months. We don't want a temporary drop in the share price to allow someone to get a commanding position and launch a bid which does not offer full value."" Under law in the U.S. state of Delaware, a company gaining a 15 percent stake in Millennium would see those shares become worthless. They would carry no vote or liquidation value unless the board had been approached first. But the poison pill clause ends after one year, said the chemicals company chief, freeing the way for a possible bid. Another factor which has damped Millennium's core valuation has been poor trading which has dogged the chemicals market leading to plant closures and asset writedowns of $60 million at SCM. Landuyt said that a further $15 million charge still had to be levied. He said the impact on trading profits would be neutral and also said signs of an uptick remain. He expected SCM to be able to make its October price increases stick after heavy destocking by customers. Quantum's recently reported improvement in pricing and demand also continues, he said.

"Ecological warfare has broken out across the British construction industry, striking some of the biggest corporates as activists give up peaceful protests and seek to hit builders where it hurts -- their profit margins. Described by one British company as ""eco-terrorism"", it is seen as the new business risk of the 1990s. Famous names like Tarmac Plc, Costain Group Plc and ARC, a unit of conglomerate Hanson Plc, have all been targeted. Activist groups are no longer seen by British firms as a harmless, badly organised ragbag of students and hippies. ""You only have to see them in action at protests,"" said David Harding, spokesman at ARC, Hanson's aggregates company. ""They walk around with mobile phones and camera equipment, they communicate and gather support for demos via the Internet -- we're talking about a highly sophisticated organisation."" One road protestor under the codename Steady Eddie told construction journal ""Building"" earlier this year, ""If it comes down to full-scale economic warfare, we will aim to drive them out of business."" As well as financial threats, companies also emphasise the ""terror"" tactics used. Costain's contract to build the controversial Newbury bypass, which runs through a conservation area, has led to violent protests delaying building, bomb threats, staff intimidation and picketing of chief executive Alan Lovell's home. A Costain spokesman told Reuters:""We've had all sorts of protests at the head office and the chief executive's house. But it's when it gets to the (employee) families -- that it goes across the line."" Tactics used by some underground groups including the cryptic Berkshire Wood Elves, which distribute leaflets with instructions on home-made explosives, are now the subject of a police investigation. Other larger activist groups include Earth First, The Land is Ours, Alarm UK and Road Alert. The groups have targeted specific projects like the Newbury bypass and the M3 motorway through Twyford Down in the southern county of Hampshire. But they are also campaigning on broader issue such as stopping the government road building programme and out-of-town superstores which they say create more traffic, pollution and damage local communities. The government has slashed its road-building spending. Although protests may have contributed to the decision it has been seen primarily as economic rather than ecological. Graham Watts, chief executive of the Construction Industry Council, said :""I don't think many firms involved in tendering for sensitive projects realise the impact environmental activity has on the cost of running a project. ""But they are more alert than they were 3-4 years ago. There's no doubt it's a big issue now."" He says the damage comes in two forms: ""Tangible -- in the form of extra costs, additional security, threats to staff and the more intangible damage caused by negative publicity."" Watts said the cost of protesting can be heavy once the company is locked into a contract. ""I do often hear on the industry circuit of tales where the company tenders at low margins and the demonstrations which follow means they are running the project at a loss."" ARC says it's not just contractors in the front line but also suppliers like itself. Its own quarries came under attack after it emerged that it may be a supplier for the Newbury bypass. ""It was called the ""First Battle of the Newbury bypass',"" said ARC's Harding. ""We had 300 Earth First protestors invade and occupy our site. Hundreds of thousands of pounds (dollars) of damage was done in one day. Plus there was the knock-on cost of lost production and extra security in future."" Simon Brown, analyst at investement bank UBS, said this new phenomenon has led to a change in the way the industry evaluates project risk. ""When talking to Tarmac about the M3 link (through Twyford Down) they made it fairly clear that their risk assessment methods have been changed and now involve a very clear environmental risk analysis."" Harding says others have done the same. ""As a result of eco-terrorism we are looking at controversial jobs more closely to see if the profit margins are wide enough to cover things like extra security."" For an industry already suffering from razor-thin margins, overcapacity and stagnant demand, eco-terrorism is the latest bizarre twist in the construction sector's tale of woe. ",EdnaFernandes
"Millennium Chemicals - the Hanson Plc company which is due to be floated off in New York on October 1 - said on Tuesday it planned a share buyback by the year 2000 after completing debt cutting and investment plans. Millennium chairman and chief executive William Landuyt told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday that he also planned a low-yielding dividend policy as he saw the company as a growth stock.   Millennium net debt levels are seen around $2.0 billion. Landuyt said the chemcials company would initiate a buyback by 2000 after reducing debt, implementing its capital expenditure plans and using proceeds from its steady cash generation. Investment plans include continued expansion in the speciality products and regions including Asia-Pacific and Western Australia. On dividend policy, Landuyt said the payout would not be high bearing in mind the need for investment and cutting debt. ""Our payout will be around 60 cents a year or 15 cents a quarter.""   ""We are not a dividend yield stock. We are a growth company,"" he concluded. On trading, Landuyt said he expected SCM to be able to make its October price increases stick after heavy destocking by customers. Quantum's recently reported improvement in pricing and demand also continues, he said. He added that the recent plant closure at SCM would have a neutral trading profit impact because the plants were not profitable and had been replaced by new more efficient plant capacity.   The closure had already resulted in $60 million of charges to write-off fixed assets, he said. But he revealed that a further $15 million charge still has to be levied. --London newsroom +44 171 5427717 ",EdnaFernandes
"All four Hanson companies - due to be spun off as part of the demerger process - had received takeover approaches for part or all of the units in the chemicals, tobacco, building and energy sectors. William Landuyt, chairman and chief executive of Millennium Chemicals and a Hanson group board member, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday ""We've had interest for every business in Hanson."" He said the ""expressions of interest"" included possible offers for whole divisions as well as individual companies within each of the four divisions to be floated separately.   Landuyt, who will head up the U.S. chemicals giant Millennium which had 1995 sales of more than two billion stg and 588 million stg in operating profit, told Reuters his own empire had received approaches for all three of its units - Quantum, SCM and Glidco. But he said that the board had decided against pursuing any of the approaches. Landuyt also defended Millennium's decision to incorporate a so-called ""poison pill"" clause to protect it from a hostile takeover. He said it was necessary to prevent a predator buying up shares on the cheap and launching an undervalued bid.   ""We do expect selling pressure (for Millennium shares) for at least the first six months,"" said Landuyt who predicted selling pressure from UK investors. ""We don't want a temporary drop in the shareprice to allow someone to get a commanding position and launch a bid which does not offer full value."" He said the poison-pill arrangement, which under law in the U.S. state of Delaware means that a company gaining a 15 percent stake in Millennium would see those shares become worthless. They would carry no vote or liquidation value unless the board had been approached first.   However, the poison pill clause ends after one year, said the chemicals company chief, freeing the way for a possible bid. He said if a full-value bid was launched before then, the board would be under a duty to examine it. -- London newsroom +44 171 5427717 ",EdnaFernandes
"Imperial Tobacco Group Plc, fresh from its demerger from Hanson Plc in October, said on Monday it was capable of cutting back debt levels and investing in further export growth as a dual policy. Gareth Davis, chief executive, told Reuters in an interview that the two could be achieved ""in parallel"" because of the group's strong cash generation. In particular, Davis said Imperial was in talks with a Japanese company about entering the Japanese market for the first time. He also said the group would keep open the option of a share buyback in the future. Imperial inherited around 1.1 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) of debt as its legacy from the Hanson family break-up. But Davis said this did not hamper the group's plans to seek distribution deals or joint ventures in the overseas cigarette markets and possibly examine small acquisition deals in the fragmented cigar market. He added that, if an important larger-sized acquisition opportunity arose, he would be prepared to raise debt levels, but for the moment ""the priority is to get it down. Our situation, our ability to generate cash means we can do things in parallel - pay down debt and pay for acquisitions...Bolt-on acquisitions are more likely in the cigar area"", he added. On the Japanese market in particular, Davis told Reuters ""We are looking to do something in Japan. We are actively considering this. In one way or another we will establish a presence in that market,"" admitting that talks were under way with one party. But he sought to reassure shareholders that Imperial would not squander its sound financial inheritance in its bid to catch up in the overseas field. ""In our international expansion plans I would not dream of being a balance sheet wrecker,"" he said. If Imperial failed to find the right deals, it would be prepared to conside other options to return value, he said. If a possible acquisition fails to offer sufficient rates of return ""we would say: what would a share buyback do to enhance shareholder value, rather than a potential acquisition?"" ""A buyback is something we'd never rule out. Given our cash flow characteristics people tend to say ""What are you going to do with all that cash.'"" Imperial reports its first set of results since the Hanson demerger on December 5 when it will give a trading update of the first few months since its split. Davis said he expected the British market to continue to decline at around two percent next year. But the international business, accounting for 17 percent of profits in the first eight months of the year, is expected to show continued rapid growth. ""I would be very disappointed if it wasn't 25 percent by 2000."" The last two years have seen overseas sales double, but Davis drew the line at hitting his target by 1997. ""That would be overstating it (our confidence). But the signs are the business is showing strong growth."" Despite his caution, Davis has said that the company has already clinched a deal with unions to add a third shift from May 1997 which has the potential to raise capacity at its Nottingham factory  by one third. Imperial says if a number of overseas deals start feeding through it will be ready to meet the surge in demand. The third shift could, in theory, raise Imperial's total cigarette production to 53 billion from the existing 37 billion mark. ($1=.6069 Pound) ",EdnaFernandes

"Environmental warfare has broken out across the British construction industry, striking some of the biggest corporations as activists give up peaceful protests and seek to hit builders where it hurts -- in their profit margins. Described by one British company as ""eco-terrorism,"" it is seen as the new business risk of the 1990s. Famous names like Tarmac Plc, Costain Group Plc and ARC, a unit of the conglomerate Hanson Plc, have all been targeted. Activist groups are no longer seen by British companies as harmless, badly organised groups of students and hippies. ""You only have to see them in action at protests,"" said David Harding, a spokesman for ARC, a unit of Hanson which supplies construction materials. ""They walk around with mobile phones and camera equipment, they communicate and gather support for demos via the Internet -- we're talking about a highly sophisticated organisation."" One road protester, using the code name Steady Eddie, told the construction journal Building earlier this year: ""If it comes down to full-scale economic warfare, we will aim to drive them out of business."" In addition to financial threats, companies say that ""terror"" tactics are used by the activists. Costain's contract to build the controversial Newbury bypass, which runs through a conservation area, has led to violent protests delaying building. There have also been bomb threats, staff intimidation and picketing of Chief Executive Alan Lovell's home. A Costain spokesman told Reuters: ""We've had all sorts of protests at the head office and the chief executive's house. But it's when it gets to the (employee) families -- that it goes across the line."" Tactics used by some underground groups, including the cryptic Berkshire Wood Elves, which distributes leaflets with instructions on homemade explosives, are now the subject of a police investigation. Larger activist groups include Earth First, The Land is Ours, Alarm UK and Road Alert. The groups have targeted specific projects like the Newbury bypass and the M3 highway through Twyford Down in the southern county of Hampshire. But they are also campaigning on broader issue such as stopping the government road-building programme and stopping out-of-town superstores, which they say create more traffic and pollution and damage local communities. The government has slashed its road-building spending, but it has been seen primarily as economic rather than environmental, although protests may have contributed to the decision. Graham Watts, chief executive of the Construction Industry Council, said, ""I don't think many firms involved in tendering (bidding) for sensitive projects realise the impact environmental activity has on the cost of running a project. ""But they are more alert than they were three-four years ago. There's no doubt it's a big issue now."" He says the damage comes in two forms: ""Tangible -- in the form of extra costs, additional security, threats to staff and the more intangible -- damage caused by negative publicity."" Watts said the cost of protesting can be heavy once the company is locked into a contract. ""I do often hear on the industry circuit of tales where the company tenders at low margins and the demonstrations which follow means they are running the project at a loss.""

"Imperial Tobacco Plc, fresh from its split from Hanson Plc, has admitted that its former parent group did receive a takeover approach prior to the demerger but rejected it because the price was too low. Imperial's chief executive Gareth Davis told Reuters in an interview this week: ""A phone call was made to Grosvenor Place (Hanson's headquarters) but they were talking silly prices."" He confirmed that the interested party was a tobacco firm, but refused to comment on recent speculation that B.A.T. Industries Plc was a potential buyer. ",EdnaFernandes
"Imperial Tobacco Plc spelled out its blueprint for export growth this week, seeking to silence critics of its strategy who have contributed to driving down the shareprice by 17 percent since its Oct 1 demerger from Hanson Plc. Imperial's chain-smoking chief executive, Gareth Davis, who joined the company after graduating from Sheffield University in 1972, told Reuters in an interview that investors should not under-estimate his determination to expand exports fast. ""Admittedly we were a late entrant to international markets. But that's because we had to get our costs licked,"" he said. Getting costs licked helped make Imperial one of the most efficient players in its sector in the 10 years under Hanson's ownership, with productivity raised by 195 percent in a decade. Davis sees it continuing to grow by eight to nine percent over the next four years, he said. But recently Imperial has seen its shares slide, partly due to concerns that most of its profits (85 percent) stem from a shrinking British market. Analysts are asking how Imperial can invest in export growth while cutting back its sizable 1.1 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) in debt. Natwest Markets and Credit Lyonnais issued sell notes on Imperial this month. But SBC Warburg said it was undervalued, citing its efficiency and greater attraction as a bid target over Gallaher, the American Brands UK unit due to be demerged. Davis sought to answer the critics this week. ""The priority is to get it (debt) down. Our situation, our ability to generate cash means we can do things in parallel -- pay down debt and pay for acquisitions."" Bolt-on acquisitions are likely in cigars. Expanding on his growth plans, he said ""We have already grown profits with little dilution of margins. Our strategy to grow is very much a multi-pronged route. ""We roll out our American brand success in France to Germany and Spain as well. We continue to follow the Brits into key holiday and work markets abroad. Keep developing the hand rolling product, seek bolt-on acquisitions and develop in selected emerging markets."" He said these key markets in Asia and China already had a preference for the Virginia style of cigarette, a plain unflavoured tobacco variety which is Imperial's strength. ""We're not a Philip Morris or B.A.T(BATS.L. We're not a major global player and we don't see this as a head-on collision. These markets are so massive that even developing a small part of it will have a big impact on our profits."" The company has already set up a base in Hong Kong, with a senior marketing recruit from Marlboro cigarettes. It is establishing four bases in China and has a technical co-operation agreement with China's state tobacco company. It is focused on developing in Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia and Indonesia. ""More specifically, the group is in talks with one party in Japan about entering that market for the first time. This deal is likely to be a distribution agreement."" The group said it will seek joint ventures and distribution deals in these emerging markets. Imperial is already gearing up to cope with a possible surge in production at its Nottingham plant in Britain. Company bosses clinched a deal with unions to add a third shift from May onwards, which could allow capacity to be raised by one third to 53 billion cigarettes from 37 billion. Davis has pledged shareholder value through expansion. But if cash builds up and there are no buying opportunities the company will consider a share buy back. Imperial's boss is sanguine about the roller coaster ride for its shareprice since demerger. Its strong debut lit up the tobacco sector, taking Imperial to a high of 438 pence per share. But it has since fallen back to 361 1/2 pence. He cited ""overheating in the first days, with rumours of a dawn raid (on shares) that never happened."" He also cited some selling of shares by U.S. retail investors, but said the holdings were eventually soaked up by US institutions. ""There'll be a wee bit of volatility for a while longer,"" said Davis who sees a truer value at between 390 pence and 410. ($1=.6050 Pound) ",EdnaFernandes
"The story of Sea Launch sounds like the daring fiction of a Bond movie -- with corporate giants from Russia, the U.S., Norway and Ukraine joining forces to build the ultimate in space technology, firing satellite rockets into space from the Pacific Ocean. The cost is 350 million pounds ($583.2 million), funded by a consortium of four firms, joining the East and West in a deal which claims it can undercut the cost of land-based launchers including the French-led Ariane, recently embarrassed by a rocket explosion, and Nasa of the U.S.. The lead Sea Launch investor is Boeing Commercial Space Co of the U.S., holding 40 percent, with  RSC-Energia of Russia taking a 25 percent slice, Norway's Kvaerner with 20 percent and  NPO-Yuzhnoye of the Ukraine holding 15 percent. At a sneak preview in Norway on Thursday, Svein Johnsen, Sea Launch project manager from Kvaerner joked with Russian reporters that countries which had once built technology with the conflict in mind, were now united in their quest for profit. ""In the name of detente,"" he said. Norway's Kvaerner is the prime contractor, building the mobile sea-borne rocket launch platform and the command ship. It rescued the Ocean Odyssey oil rig which exploded in a fireball just after the 1988 Piper Alpha rig disaster. Odyssey has since been stripped and reconstructed to become the floating rocket launcher which will operate under remote control from a specially built command ship. The platform is nearing completion at Stavanger in Norway, with the command ship under construction and ready for launch next month at Govan in Scotland. The first rocket launch will happen in June 1998. The rig and command ship will travel from the base in Long Island, California and travel to a site in the Pacific Ocean for blast off. Satellites and rockets will be assembled on the ship for transfer to the platform which will be evacuated before lift-off. The command ship will press the control button for firing the rocket at a distance of two or three miles. The 10,600 ton ship has the added protection of blast-proof safety glass at a cost of 2,000 pounds a pane. The Russians will provide the Zenit rockets, chosen because they can be assembled horizontally on board the command ship. Boeing will provide project management, marketing services and run the operation for lift-off. Asked about the risk of explosion Johnsen says ""The risk of explosion is very much related to this business. But we think that risk is very low. There are in-built safety features and it's a very sound operation from an insurance point of view."" Ignition to release of the rocket takes 4.6 seconds, with emissions from the rocket on take-off channelled sideways. ""If the emissions didn't go sideways, the pressure could shift the platform,"" he said, which weighs 23,000 tons. Confidence in the system, a world-first, has been demonstrated by a rash of early contracts. Hughes Space and Communications International Inc of Los Angeles, California has 10 launches signed. Space Systems/Lorel, also from California has five booked. The groups involved have refused to comment on how much they will charge per launch or on potential profits, with Kvaerner's Johnson only stating that its slice will be ""A good return on our investment."" It will be able to fire six to eight rockets a year. The idea was originally conceived by Boeing which had intended to fire satellites from a supertanker. But the danger involved made the platform idea more appealing, allowing evacuation before blast off. ($ = 0.600 British Pounds) ",EdnaFernandes
"The 350 million stg Sea Launch satellite project -- backed by firms from the U.S., Russia, Norway and Ukraine -- will fire its first satellite from a sea platform in June 1998, project contractor Kvaerner told reporters on Thursday. Kavaerner, which also has a 20 percent stake in the project, is overseeing the construction of the launch platform and control ship, at Stavanger, Norway and Goven, Scotland.   Boeing Commercial Space Co of the United States, Russia's RSC-Energia and the Ukraine's NPO-Yuzhnoye are also involved in the project. As well as being a shareholder, Kavaerner is receiving a 250 million stg fee to build the ship and platform launcher. In Stavanger, Sea Launch project manager Svein Johnsen told Reuters that launch prices would be ""significantly cheaper"" than those charged by land-based sites, but refused to be drawn further. Hughes Space &amp; Communication International Inc has a contract for 10 launches and Space Systems/Lorel for five. Sea Launch will use a converted oil rig called Odyssey to fire Russian-made Zenits rockets from a position in the Pacific. The rockets will be transported and assembled on the control ship. The 640 feet ship, still to be named, will have blast proof safety glass. It weighs 10,600 tons and can carry 250 crew. The platform weighs 23,000 tons, is 430 feet long and has room for 20 crew members. ",EdnaFernandes
"Britain's biggest builder Taylor Woodrow has finally got something to celebrate in 1996, its 75th anniversary year, reversing 1995's share slide to outpace the market and assuring investors that year results remain on track. Colin Parsons, Taylor's chairman, told Reuters in an interview that the second half performance so far has been ""exactly as we indicated in the half year statement,"" when he described the outlook as ""encouraging."" Taylor's shares hit a high of 183 pence in September after those results, with profits up 81 percent at 25.4 million pounds ($42.37 million). The shares have since edged off that five-year peak to 156 pence, but are still outperforming the Financial Times All Share index by 30 percent and the building and construction sector by 18 percent, according to Reuters Securities 3000 data. The group has clawed its way back from a share price nadir of 53 pence in July 1991, in the depths of the building recession when the group's results slumped to a 66 million pounds loss. Taylor Woodrow is probably most famous for its international contracting activities, with involvement in high-profile projects from the Channel Tunnel to the building of a light railway in Malaysia. But contracting offers the lowest growth potential in future. Instead revenue growth will stem from housing and land development, property and the Greenham Trading unit in that order, with contracting lagging last. Commenting on current trading,, Parsons said contracting remained very tough, citing in particular the expense of operating in the British Private Finance Initiative (PFI) market - aiming to get private money into public infrastructure projects. ""PFI remains a very expensive business - too expensive for an industry operating on a zero percent margin basis,"" he said. The industry has often complained about the high bidding costs - sometimes running to millions of pounds and delays from red-tape adding to costs further. Parsons also says ""It's not a question of allocating capital but whether we want to carry the risks associated with it."" Parsons says that does not mean Taylor Woodrow will bail out, but it will be selective. He adds that ""overseas business is encouraging,"" however, offering higher-margin business. Taylor Woodrow remains committed to its four-business strategy, with Parsons comparing it to ""sitting on a chair instead of relying on the uncomfortable shooting stick of having one business. When the wind blows you know where you are on a chair."" He has refuted suggestions that it may bail out of constracting. But admits that money for acquisitions will be targeted at the other businesses. Commenting on trading since the first half, Parsons said the UK housing market recovery ""...has now spread into the new home market and is doing well in the second half. The first half was much slower."" ""In Canada housing had a dreadful year in the worst market for 40 years, I believe."" ""Australia seems to be one of the worst markets in living memory. It shows no improvement but it's happening at the same time as a relatively strong Australian economy. He added ""It will be well into next year before we see any improvement."" The California and Florida markets were reported to be doing well, however. The outlook for the group's results have brightened, with analysts' forecasts for pretax profits in the year ending 31 December 1996 seen at between 63 and 67 million, a rise of 41 percent on 1995 figures. For the year ending 1997, the forecasts range from 70 to 80 million, a rise of 16 percent. Simon Brown, analyst at UBS said Taylor's performance turnaround was partly down to ""swift and aggressive action to downsize contracting activities"" into a single operation spanning Africa, Asia Pacific, Middle East and Europe. ""It's closed non-profit making areas and is now investing in areas where it can get a good return,"" he said. The residual contracting business remained a sound business. UBS has the shares on hold. ""It will move ahead but it will not outperform sharply,"" he said. ($1=.5994 Pound) ",EdnaFernandes
"The British government on Tuesday said the design of Eurotunnel's freight trains would have to be scrutinised after a massive fire swept through one of its main tunnels, injuring eight people and causing wide damage. British transport secretary Sir George Young told parliament he was sure the Anglo-French Channel Tunnel Safety Authority would look at the design aspects after warnings from British fire chiefs about the safety of the trains. Any changes to the design of Eurotunnel carriages would be another costly blow to the Channel Tunnel operator which recently came back from the brink of bankruptcy after restructuring its nine billion pounds ($15 billion) in debt. The fire, the first serious incident since the tunnel opened two years ago, halted services on Tuesday. Even if limited services resume on Wednesday, Eurotunnel warned that traffic capacity would be cut to one third of normal levels for an indefinite period. The fire and worries about the extent of damage and a resultant safety review hit Eurotunnel shares. In London, they closed down 4-1/2 pence at 87 pence while in Paris the stock dropped 1.28 percent to 7.65 francs per share. But trading in its debt was barely changed. One freight customer TNT Express Worldwide said it would be relying more on ferries as a result of the fire. Eurotunnel confirmed in a statement that 15 heavy goods vehicles and the rear locomotive had suffered ""severe"" damage. The fire was reported to have started in a goods carriage carrying a truck holding flammable polystyrene but Eurotunnel said the cause had not yet been determined. The goods vehicle shuttles have partially open sides - the safety of which had been questioned by the British fire brigade some years before. Mike Frattini, fire officer and spokesman for the Kent Fire Brigade which helped put out the fire, told Reuters earlier: ""Our chief officer warned the safety committee (for the tunnel) five years ago."" He suggested that fire fighters could raise this issue once again with the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority. Eurotunnel's spokesman refused to comment on whether changes will need to be made to carriages, adding that: ""It is a key question."" A spokesman for the Department of Transport told Reuters that past concerns about the safety of these carriages had led to Eurotunnel carrying out safety tests two years ago. ""They were then approved in May 1994,"" he said. Apart from possible safety changes, Eurotunnel faces other heavy costs. The first is lost revenue due to reduced traffic. A Eurotunnel spokesman in London told Reuters ""We will operate at one third of normal capacity and we will give priority to Eurostar (passenger) trains. But there will still be space for shuttle trains as well."" He did not say how many Eurostar or Le Shuttle trains would be cancelled as a result of the fire. Eurotunnel confirmed in a statement that 15 heavy goods vehicles and the rear locomotive had suffered ""severe"" damage. ""It is a serious accident,"" chairman Patrick Ponsolle said. A Eurotunnel spokesman said the cost of repairs was not yet known. ""It's quite messy down there. There will be damage to the overhead powerline cables, the heat will have buckled the steel rails and the carriages involved would be very badly damaged and may need to be replaced,"" he said. The cost of a new goods train is 25 million pounds, but Eurotunnel said it did not think an entire train would need replacing. It faces costs in repairing tunnel and rolling stock damage and may face compensation costs, possibly involving paying for customers to travel by ferry or air, although the company said it is heavily insured. The fire comes just before Christmas when the tunnel was expecting a surge in holiday sales. But pre-holiday publicity now consists of media reports of choking people emerging from smoke and ""blow-torch""-like heat. Asked whether this would dampen customer demand, Eurotunnel said ""We hope not. But what's happened has happened and how the fire was handled should renew confidence in our safety procedures,"" said the press officer. ($1=.5970 Pound) ",EdnaFernandes
"Eurotunnel Plc, the Anglo-French Channel Tunnel operator, said on Tuesday that its traffic will be cut to one third of normal levels after a fire swept through one of its main tunnels on Monday night, injuring eight people. Services have been terminated until the tunnel affected is cleared. A Eurotunnel spokesman in London said there was no fixed time for when services would resume or how long reduced capacity will operate once the tunnel is opened. News of the fire and worries about the extent of damage and a resultant safety review hit Eurotunnel's shares in both London and Paris. The fire is the latest issue to dog Eurotunnel's performance which has been plagued by negotiations to rejig nine billion pounds ($15 billion) in debt. In London, Eurotunnel shares fell 3-1/2 pence to 88 pence while in Paris the stock was down around two percent at 7.68 francs per share. But trading in its debt was barely changed. Commenting on the initial impact on traffic, a Eurotunnel spokesman in London said, ""We will operate at one third of normal capacity and we will give priority to Eurostar (passenger) trains. But there will still be space for shuttle trains as well."" He did not say how many Eurostar or Le Shuttle trains would be cancelled as a result. The Tunnel's operations were closed after a fire engulfed part of one of two tunnels, near to Calais where parties from France and Britain had been holding a safety conference. The Eurotunnel spokesman said it did not yet know the full extent of damage to rolling stock or the tunnel itself or how much it could cost, but admitted it was a ""very ferocious fire."" ""It's quite messy down there. There will be damage to the overhead powerline cables, the heat will have buckled the steel rails and the carriages involved would be very badly damaged and may need to be replaced,"" he said. The cost of a new train is 25 million pounds, but Eurotunnel did not think an entire train would need replacing. But Eurotunnel faces costs in repairing tunnel and rolling stock damage and may face compensation costs, possibly involving paying for customers to travel by ferry or air. The company said at this stage that it does not know the cause of the fire. But unconfirmed media reports say the fire began in a truck carrying inflammable polystyrene. The heavy goods vehicle shuttles are known to have partially open sides -- the safety of which had been questioned by the British fire brigade some years before. Mike Frattini, fire officer and spokesman for the Kent Fire Brigade which helped put out the tunnel fire, said earlier: ""Our chief officer warned the safety committee (for the tunnel) five years ago."" Fire fighters could raise this objection again as part of the investigation which will go to the Anglo-French Channel Tunnel Safety Authority. If the current goods carriages are deemed to be hazardous in light of the accident there could be a call for changes, incurring further costs to Eurotunnel. Eurotunnel's spokesman refused to comment on whether changes will need to be made to carriages, adding that ""It is a key question."" The fire comes just before Christmas when the tunnel was expected to see a surge in holiday sales. But pre-holiday publicity now consists of media reports of choking people emerging from smoke and ""blow-torch""-like heat. Asked whether this would dampen customer demand, Eurotunnel said ""We hope not. But what's happened has happened and how the fire was handled should renew confidence in our safety procedures,"" said the press officer. One analyst at Natwest Securities said there should be little further impact on shares or consumer confidence. Shares in cross-channel ferry operator P&amp;O were five pence higher at 602-1/2p.

"The story of Sea Launch sounds like the daring fiction of a James Bond movie -- with corporate giants from Russia, the United States, Norway and Ukraine joining forces to build the ultimate in space technology, firing satellite rockets into space from the Pacific Ocean. The cost is 350 million pounds ($583.2 million), funded by a consortium of four companies, joining the East and West in a deal that claims it can undercut the cost of land-based launchers including the French-led Ariane, recently embarrassed by a rocket explosion, and NASA. The lead Sea Launch investor is Boeing Co.'s Commercial Space division, holding 40 percent, with RSC-Energia of Russia taking a 25 percent slice, Norway's Kvaerner with 20 percent and NPO-Yuzhnoye of Ukraine holding 15 percent. At a sneak preview in Norway recently, Svein Johnsen, Sea Launch project manager from Kvaerner, joked with Russian reporters that countries that had once built technology with conflict in mind were now united in their quest for profit. ""In the name of detente,"" he said. Norway's Kvaerner is the prime contractor, building the mobile seaborne rocket launch platform and the command ship. It rescued an off-shore oil rig, which had been severely damaged in a 1988 explosion, and rebuilt it to become a floating rocket launcher that will operate under remote control from a specially built command ship. The platform is nearing completion at Stavanger in Norway, with the command ship under construction and ready for launch next month at Govan in Scotland. The first rocket launch is scheduled for June 1998 from a site in the Pacific Ocean. Satellites and rockets will be assembled on the ship for transfer to the platform, which will be evacuated before liftoff. The command ship will press the control button for firing the rocket at a distance of two or three miles. The 10,600-ton ship has the added protection of blastproof safety glass. The Russians will provide the Zenit rockets, chosen because they can be assembled horizontally on board the command ship. Boeing will provide project management, marketing services and run the operation for liftoff. Asked about the risk of explosion Johnsen said, ""The risk of explosion is very much related to this business. But we think that risk is very low. There are built-in safety features and it's a very sound operation from an insurance point of view."" Ignition to release of the rocket takes 4.6 seconds, with emissions from the rocket on takeoff channelled sideways. ""If the emissions didn't go sideways, the pressure could shift the platform,"" he said, which weighs 23,000 tons. Confidence in the system, a world-first, has been demonstrated by a rash of early contracts. Hughes Space and Communications International Inc. of Los Angeles has 10 launches signed. Space Systems/Loral, also from California has five booked. The groups involved have refused to comment on how much they will charge per launch or on potential profits, with Kvaerner's Johnson only stating that its slice will be ""a good return on our investment."" It will be able to fire six to eight rockets a year. The idea was originally conceived by Boeing, which had intended to fire satellites from a supertanker. But the danger involved made the platform idea more appealing, allowing evacuation before blastoff. ",EdnaFernandes
"Debt-laden Eurotunnel faced fresh financial pressure on Wednesday in the wake of the fire which swept through a main tunnel leaving a trail of damage, no running services and shaken consumer confidence. Just one month after coming back from the brink of bankruptcy with a restructuring of nine billion pounds ($15 billion) of debt, the company faced uncertainy once again as one of its two rail tunnels remained shut pending a safety review. Analysts said the modest fall in Eurotunnel shares since Monday's fire was about right, however, and few believed there would be long-term damage to customer confidence. Eurotunnel has warned of reduced services for weeks ahead as repair work goes ahead and eats into revenues. And one source close to Eurotunnel told Reuters that the cost of repairs may be heavier than first thought. ""The cost will be millions (of pounds) and could get into double figures, it you consider the damage to the 15 wagons and a locomotive, plus severe tunnel damage."" He added that track sections may also need replacing after buckling in the intense heat. While the tunnel remains shut, Eurotunnel is losing revenues at the rate of one million pounds a day. It also faces the cost of compensating passengers and tranferring them by air or ferry. A Eurotunnel spokesman said all these costs should be covered by insurance, however. ""It will have very little impact,"" said one analyst. ""Transport disasters are always newsworthy but the bad publicity will soon fade away. Eurotunnel will be financially damaged, but you have to look at it in relation to the nine billion of debt."" The ferries have been scooping up extra business from big freight customers like TNT, which said it would be using the ferries more as a result of the tunnel fire. Andrew Darke, analyst at Williams de Broe, said ""There's clearly going to be some emotional reaction, but I expect it to be short-lived. After all passenger numbers rose after the Herald of Free Enterprise (ferry) disaster nine years ago. ""Disasters don't stop people travelling. People still go shopping in London despite IRA bombs,"" he said. Eurotunnel had around 45 percent of the cross-Channel ferry market before the fire -- a share won partly by waging a cut-throat price-war with the ferries, which have since proposed linking up to battle against their tunnel rival. Swedish ferry giant Stena Line and P&amp;O agreed to merge in October and are awaiting clearance from competition bodies. Darke said P&amp;O's chances of clearance had been boosted by the tunnel disaster. The verdict is due later this month. ""The government wants a viable alternative to the tunnel for emergencies like this. That means the ferry business has to be economically viable. So the fire has probably improved the chances of the merger being approved."" Last month Eurotunnel agreed a debt deal with its banks, giving them 45.5 percent of the company in return for wiping out one billion pounds of debt. The deal fixed and capped interest payments and the company said it would be unable to pay a dividend for 10 years as it uses cash flow to service its debt. Some analysts, such as UBS, remain sceptical, pointing out that the tunnel's present cash flow of 150-200 million pounds per annum over its remaining 52-year concession to operate the tunnel comes in at six billion pounds, still well short of the total remaining debt. Eurotunnel shares on Tuesday were at 86-1/2pence, down 1-1/2, compared to the 544 pence high touched on December 31 1993. In Paris, the shares were down 20 centimes at 7.5 francs.

"Drugs giant Glaxo Wellcome Plc bought the remaining 50 percent of its Japanese joint venture Nippon Glaxo for 354 million pounds ($596 million) on Thursday in its quest for growth in the world's second biggest market. Analysts in London said they had long expected the buy-out of Japanese partner Shin Nihon Jitsugyo Co Ltd, which will also get a 7.7 million pounds (1.38 billion) payout in lieu of the 1996 dividend. Nippon Glaxo develops, produces and markets prescription medicines across Japan and has net assets of 30.7 billion yen ($275.3 million), as valued on June 30. Its post-tax profit for the six months to June 30 was 2.5 billion yen. After setting up a series of Japanese joint ventures since the early 1980s, Glaxo has moved to take them over in a bid to carve a share in Japan's lucrative marketplace, second only to the U.S. in terms of profitability and sales to the group. Seven percent of Glaxo Wellcome's profits stem from Japan, which represents 20 percent of the world market itself. One London-based pharmaceuticals analyst said: ""The deal will be slightly earnings enhancing as it's financed by debt and Japanese interest rates are low at half a percent."" The move to take over ventures in Japan would allow the group to accelerate growth plans by launching new products there, including its new respiratory treatments for asthma and the new herpes treatment Valtrex which replaces Zovirax. Another analyst agreed that Japan offered a notable expansion opportunity, saying: ""It's obviously one of the leading growth markets for Glaxo."" But shares in Glaxo showed little response, falling a modest 3.5 pence to 950 in London. Under the deal, Hiroshi Konishi, president of Nippon Glaxo, and Akira Konishi, vice-president and general manager, will give up these positions but remain members of Nippon Glaxo's board, Glaxo Wellcome said. Nippon Glaxo had net assets at June 30 of 30.7 billion yen, or 180 million pounds. Its profits after tax for the six months ended June 30 were 2.5 billion yen.

"The UK construction industry expects to get the cold shoulder from the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Finance Minister)again this year, with industry leaders predicting continued cutbacks in infrastructure spending in next Tuesday's budget. Building industry leaders say they expect no more than a few crumbs from Chancellor Kenneth Clarke next week and are forecasting even more pressure on roads spending, with some rumours that Clarke will take a further slice off the road budget this year. ""If ever there was going to be a budget with severe cuts, it's this one, which needs to make room for pre-election tax cuts,"" said Graham Watts, chief executive of industry lobby group the Construction Industry Council. As far as the housing market goes, builders are unanimous in their call for no sharp shocks to disturb the market's equilibrium. That means steady inflation and interest rates, plus no more reduction in mortgage interest tax relief, groups like the Building Employers Federation say. On the spending side, The British Road Federation, embracing builders, motor groups and oil companies, said the road budget had been cut by 25 percent in the last two years. ""We expect to see a further contraction by 200 million pounds ($337 million),"" said Federation spokesman Mark Glover ""It's already been cut for the last four years."" Spending on new roads and maintenance by government offshoot the Highways Agency was 2.04 billion pounds in 1994/95, falling to 1.75 billion pounds in 1995/96 and is expected to be down to 1.5 billion this financial year. The forecast for the year 1997/98 is seen dipping again. These cutbacks, plus reduced state investment in rail since privatisation, and the fact that hospitals are now under constrained regional budgets, have resulted in the building industry remaining in recession years after the rest of the economy moved into recovery, lobbyists claim. Few industry leaders hope for a spending increase, but they would like to see a spending freeze at best. The other issue on the construction industry's wish-list is for the Chancellor to break the log-jam holding up the private finance initiative (PFI) -- which aims to get private capital flowing into public sector projects. The PFI has replaced a lot of fresh government spending, but the frequent hold-ups to project awards due to red-tape have ",EdnaFernandes
"Christian Salvesen moved to silence critics on Monday with plans to demerge its Aggreko business and make a 150 million pound ($253 million) special payout just months after shunning a 1.1 billion hostile bid. Chris Masters, chief executive of the transport to services group, said his plans offered much better shareholder value than a rejected cash and paper bid from Hays Plc in the summer. Masters said the demerger of its Aggreko equipment hire business was the culmination of a six year restructuring process which was now boosting the Edinburgh-based company's results. Earnings unveiled on Monday showed first-half pretax profits unveiled surged to 51.6 million pounds from 45.0 million. Sales rose to 383.1 million pounds from 345.9 million. ""The board intends to pay special dividends totalling 150 million pounds, to continue the process of realising non-core assets and to demerge Aggreko within the next financial year,"" the company said in a statement. In addition to an ordinary dividend of 3.8 pence per share for the half year, the group intends to pay an enhanced dividend of 17 pence now at a cost of about 50 million pounds. ""A foreign income dividend of approximately 100 million pounds will be paid before the end of March 1997,"" it said. ""The special dividends... represent the amount which the board considers the company should prudently pay, from both a borrowing capacity and tax perspective,"" Salvesen concluded. Masters said in an interview the 150 million pound special dividend and demerger plan for the Aggreko hire business compared favourably with the 390 pence a share bid from business support company Hays that was dropped in August. Plans for the demerger and special payout had been long rumoured, although earlier estimates said the special dividend had been expected to be worth 200 million. Press reports put the value of the Aggreko demerger at around 400 million pounds. Salvesen is due to brief institutional investors about its plans over the next two weeks. Some investors expressed disappointment earlier this year that the Hays offer was rejected, complaining about the severe underperformance of Salvesen's shares in the run-up to the bid. By mid-afternoon Salvesen's shares were trading at 327-1/2 pence per share, up three and a half pence but off their highs for the day of 332. In the months to August the shares underperformed the sector by 30 percent from the start of 1996 and by 10 percent against the FT-All Share index. Since Salvesen rejected the bid, the shares have improved significantly and are currently outperforming the sector by 34 percent and the FT-All Share by 22 percent. ($1=.5941 Pound) ",EdnaFernandes
"Christian Salvesen, the transport to business services group which rejected a 1.1 billion pound hostile takeover from Hays, said on Monday its special dividend and power unit demerger gave ""much better"" shareholder value. Chris Masters, Salvesen chief executive, told Reuters in an interview ""I think this (plan) is much better"" and ""more in the interests of our shareholders."" He said he thought the 150 million pounds special dividend and demerger plan for the Aggreko hire business compared favorably with the rejected 390 pence per share bid from Hays, ditched in August.   Masters said the plan to spin off the fast-growing hire group Aggreko was the culmination of a six-year restructuring strategy. He added that a review to deliver shareholder value had already been underway before the hostile Hays bid was made in the summer. The path chosen by the board made the best financial sense in tax terms as well, he added. He said the Aggreko business was now ready to go it alone and had strong growth prospects. ""It now operates in 20 countries and is a global market leader,"" he said.   The logistics business, which will remain within the Salvesen group, also offered strong growth potential, said Masters. ""In Europe, logistics got half of its profits from food two years ago. Now that figure is less than 30 percent. Industrial logistics is growing at twenty percent per annum and the consumer business is growing at around 15 percent, with food manufacturing business also offering strong growth thanks to European deregulation."" Christian Salvesen will be making its case to institutional shareholders over the next two weeks, said Masters, in a bid to persuade them that this package offers a better deal than the 1.1 billion takeover bid from Hays. The board has been under pressure to deliver after suffering share price underperformance earlier this year against the Financial Times All Share index. --London newsroom +44 171 5427717 ",EdnaFernandes
"Debt-laden Eurotunnel is awaiting the outcome of insurer investigations into the costs of the major fire aboard a freight train last week. Lead insurer Union des Assurances De Paris (UAP) said on Tuesday it was ""impossible to quantify yet the cost of the damage."" ""Up to now, there is no reliable estimate of the amount of damage caused by the fire on November 18 in the south tunnel,"" it said, adding its maximum residual risk was 75 million francs ($14.4 million). Eurotunnel said in a statement earlier that it will hold a press conference to update the situation on Wednesday. The beleaguered tunnel operator also said the investigating judge had finished his inspection of the scene of the blaze, but insurers and company engineers were continuing to investigate. The latest statements were made amid rife speculation on the cost of the fire, including unconfirmed reports of total insured costs of as much as 200 million pounds ($334 million). Current restrictions caused by fire damage are costing the group a million pounds in lost revenue every day. Eurotunnel was also hit this week by reports of possible claims from companies operating the Eurostar high-speed train service which runs through the tunnel. Eurostar's British owners, the London and Continental Railways consortium, said there were provisions in its contract with Eurotunnel for reduced access charges if the tunnel was partially or fully closed. Eurotunnel's spokeswoman said reduced access meant Eurostar (and possibly its French and Belgian counterparts) could see ""a reduction to their payment."" She reiterated that Eurotunnel is fully insured. ""The insurance should cover loss of business, the rolling stock, damage to the tunnel, compensation,"" she said. The company declined to comment further at this stage. One source close to Eurotunnel said last week that the cost of fire damage alone to freight and to the tunnel could run to tens of millions of pounds. ""The cost will be millions (of pounds) and could get into double figures, if you consider the damage to the 15 wagons and a locomotive, plus severe tunnel damage,"" said the source. The cost of replacing a whole train was estimated at around 25 million pounds. A senior source close to Eurotunnel insurers told Reuters on Tuesday that the cost of replacing rolling stock could be ""in the range of mid- to late-teens (of millions of pounds)."" Adding to uncertainty surrounding insurance cover was the possibility that any payout could be affected by suggestions that the train was on fire before entering the tunnel. However, analysts seem confident the costs would be covered. But some said the level of losses caused by the fire were belittled by the scale of Eurotunnel's total debts. ""In relation to Eurotunnel's other financial problem of 8.8 billion (pounds) in debt anything else is incidental, even if the fire cost is 200 million at worst,"" one analyst said. Since the fire, Eurotunnel's shares have fallen from a close of 91-1/2 pence on November 18 before the fire broke out to 77-1/2 by the close on Tuesday.

"Stagecoach, the British bus and rail group which has seen its share price grow fivefold in three years, Thursday posted a bumper 127 percent rise in first-half profits, boosting its stock to a record high. The Scottish-based group, which has enjoyed explosive growth since its flotation in 1993, said half year pre-tax profits climbed to a record 47 million pounds ($79 million). The half year dividend rose 43 percent to 3 pence (5 cents) a share and group revenues leapt to 405 million pounds ($679.0 million) from 198.8 million ($333.3 million). Chairman Brian Souter called the results excellent. Shares in Stagecoach were up 45.5 pence (76.28 cents) at 629 ($10.54) by 1350 GMT (8:50 a.m. EST), leading a fleet of other bus companies higher in its wake. Go-Ahead Group rose 15 pence to 411.5 ($6.90) and Cowie Group added 5.5 pence (9.2 cents) to 396p ($6.63). ""It's good news all round. The profits are two million ($3.4 million) above what I expected. We're upgrading our year forecast by five million ($8.4 million) to 97 million pounds ($162.6 million),"" said UBS analyst Richard Hannah. The results were the first since the group's high profile acquisitions of British rail rolling stock company Porterbrook and the Swedish bus group Swebus. ""The integration of Porterbrook and Swebus is proceeding and I am confident of a successful outcome,"" said Souter. Porterbook and the bus operations were the real driver behind the growth in profits. The figures were also flattered by a one-off gain of 15 million pounds ($25.1 million) from the sale of a 21.7 percent stake in Strathclyde Buses. This was reflected in the high half-year payout. Porterbook's profits were better than expected at 13.5 million pounds ($22.6 million) in the six weeks since it was acquired. ""That's about two million ($3.4 million) profit a week on operating profit margins of 40 percent,"" said Hannah. Stagecoach finance director Keith Cochrane said operating profits would ease slightly in the latter part of the year as the company took on ""on-going expenditure for maintenance.""

Ian Lang, president of the Board of Trade, said he had asked the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) to study competition effects of the deal -- hatched to help the ferry giants counter the impact on the market of Eurotunnel's Channel Tunnel. Most Eurotunnel services, including its own passenger and freight shuttles and intercity rail trains run by Eurostar, were suspended following a serious fire last week. Although the government gave no explanation of its motives for the review, both P&amp;O and share analysts said it seemed to be partly motivated by Eurotunnel's suspension of services. P&amp;O immediately slammed the move, calling it ""totally unnecessary"". Its shares dipped on the news, and were down 6-1/2 pence at 589 1/2 pence by 1300 GMT. P&amp;O chairman Lord Sterling said the two ferry companies' plans had now been ""kicked into touch for three months,"" as the MMC has been given until March 6, 1997 to review the deal. The two old shipping rivals unveiled plans in October to join forces on three routes across the English Channel, in response to the swift progress made by the tunnel in grabbing a 40 percent market share on the route two years after opening. The tunnel opted for an aggressive pricing policy as it built up its market presence, cutting deep into the ferry lines' profits as firms led by P&amp;O European Ferries and Stena Sealink responded with parallel price-cuts and expensive extra ships. The ferry duo's planned merger was designed to rationalise their capacity on the key short-sea section where the Channel is at its narrowest, crossing times are short and competition for millions of passengers and freight units a year is most fierce. The ferry giants said the link-up would allow them to slash 75 million pounds ($126 million) off a combined fixed cost base of 280 million pounds, as well as building up cash generation. P&amp;O's Sterling argued on Thursday that Eurotunnel's fire had done nothing to change the economic arguments for a ferry link-up to remove excess capacity. ""Although the tunnel is temporarily out of action due to the unfortunate fire, I cannot see how the MMC reference will change the underlying situation,"" the statement quoted him as saying. With Eurotunnel taking 45 percent of the market, P&amp;O added, ""it is difficult to see that there is any competition concern that requires investigation."" James Halstead, analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing in London, said the referral decision was slightly unexpected and disappointing for the market. ""They were effectively given the green light in the summer by the government when the injunction on a merger was removed, and the government saw the impact on business after the Channel Tunnel opened. We thought there would be no problem,"" he said. In Sweden, Stena Line's shares dipped 0.80 crowns to 28.50 after the news. ($1=.5956 Pound) ",EdnaFernandes
"Stagecoach Plc, the bus to rail operator which has seen its shareprice double in under a year, said on Thursday it expected ongoing progress in dividend growth after reporting record profits of 47 million stg.

"LucasVarity Plc, the U.S.-Anglo auto components giant formed in September, announced a major restructuring Tuesday, including the planned disposal of 13 non-core businesses and the elimination of 3,000 jobs over two years. LucasVarity said it had identified a range of additional moves that will mean an extra 120 million British pounds ($200 million) in profit benefits -- double the level anticipated just three months ago when the company was formed in the merger of Lucas Industries of Britain and Varity Corp. of Buffalo, N.Y. Worldwide employment will be cut by 3,000 over the next two years as a result of the moves, the company said. LucasVarity said it also will take an extra one-time charge of 130 million pounds ($217 million), mainly in non-cash items, along with 120 million pounds ($200 million) in charges already planned for this year. Thirteen companies were identified for sale in a three-month post-merger review, although only eight were named in the restructuring announcement -- all small businesses in Britain, Argentina and South Africa. Chief Executive Victor Rice said in an interview that the company was ""sifting through some offers"" and expected to be in ""active negotiations"" on the sale of some of the 13 units quite soon. Rice said major businesses like aerospace and electronics were not among the unnamed five. The criteria for divestment were those firms which ""neither fitted into the core strategy of the company or contributed economic added value,"" Rice said. Rice, who came from Varity, said the post-divestment savings were ""virtually double"" original expectations. LucasVarity is involved in the design, manufacture and supply of systems, products and services in international automotive, diesel engine, aftermarket and aerospace industries. Both parties in the merger specialised in braking systems and industry sources expected that many of the measures would affect production and employment in these units. ",EdnaFernandes
"Anglo-U.S. autocomponents giant LucasVarity unveiled a major corporate shake-up on Tuesday planning 13 non-core disposals and a speeded-up rationalisation which will axe 3,000 jobs worldwide over two years. LucasVarity, created by a merger earlier this year of Britain's Lucas Industries and Varity Corp of the U.S., said it had identified a range of additional restructuring plans that meant it now saw operating savings of 120 million pounds ($200.2 million) -- double the level anticipated after the merger. The market initially welcomed the news and the company's shares jumped to a new 12-month high of 263 pence. But downbeat company comments about the auto industry during a telephone conference call to analysts sent the stock slumping to close a sharp 16.5 pence lower at 234p. ""They said that things were relatively tough in France and in the heavy truck market, particularly in Europe, and that they weren't immune to the trends we are seeing in the (competitive) market,"" said one analyst, who declined to be named. LucasVarity expects to take an extra one-off charge of 130 million pounds, mainly in non-cash items, which will be levied along with 120 million pounds of costs already planned for current year accounts. Worldwide headcount will be cut by 3,000 over the next two years as a result of the moves, the company said. Thirteen companies have been marked up for sale after the three-month review which came in the wake of the multi-billion pounds merger between Britain's Lucas Industries and Varity Corp of the U.S. which became effective in September this year. Commenting on the speed of disposals, Victor Rice, chief executive, told Reuters the group was ""sifting through some offers"" and expected to be in ""active negotiations"" on the sale of some of the 13 quite soon. Only eight of the 13 businesses marked for sale were named in the restructuring statement released earlier. Rice said that major businesses like aerospace and electronics were not among the unnamed five. The eight named so far are small niche businesses and include starter and alternator firms in Britain, Argentina and South Africa. The 13 disposal targets have combined sales of 270 million pounds. The criteria for divestment were those firms which ""neither fitted into the core strategy of the company or contributed economic added value,"" said Rice. Commenting on the rationalisation moves, Rice, who came from the Varity side of the merger, said ""the combination of cost savings and anticipated revenue growth identified by these teams will help the company achieve the aggressive performance targets it has set for itself.""

"Computer Associates International Inc., a leading maker of software for businesses, said Monday it agreed to pay about $1.2 billion for Cheyenne Software Inc. Computer Associates, the largest independent maker of business software for mainframe computers, said it will offer $30.50 in cash for each share of Cheyenne. Cheyenne's stock jumped $7.625 to $30 in afternoon trading on the American Stock Exchange. Computer Associates' stock gained 62.5 cents to $63.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. While investors applauded the announcement, industry analysts said they were puzzled by what they viewed as the expensive price Computer Associates agreed to pay. ""This is departure from their standard practice,"" said UBS Securities analyst Joseph Farley. ""They are paying more than they ever have. There's clearly some synergies,"" he added. ""The question is whether those synergies are worth seven times sales."" Cheyenne reported revenues of $174.1 million in its fiscal year ending June 1996. The deal, which has been rumoured for several months, has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both Cheyenne and Computer Associates, the companies said. Roslyn, N.Y.-based Cheyenne makes storage management, anti-virus and communications software products designed to run on client/server networks in which personal computers are tied together in a network run by a larger computer, or server. Computer Associates said Cheyenne's products will bolster its own systems management software offerings, which run on both client/server and mainframe computer networks. CA derives a majority of its revenues from mainframe software. ""We are extremely excited by the synergistic nature of this acquisition,"" said CA Chairman Charles Wang. Computer Associates said it will fund the acquisition through cash balances and existing credit facilities. ""Cheyenne is the recognised leader in storage management solutions for the Windows NT and NetWare environments,"" Wang said in a statement. ""The addition of its product suite will strengthen our efforts in the desktop and LAN environments."" Computer Associates said it intended to retain all of Cheyenne's employees. It is expected that Cheyenne will operate as a division of Computer Associates and will continue to support its current distribution channel strategy. Both companies are based on New York's Long Island. Earlier this year, Cheyenne successively waged an aggressive fight to fend off a $1 billion unwelcome takeover bid by McAffee Associates Inc, a rival maker of systems management and anti-virus software. Since 1976, Computer Associates has grown through a campaign of approximately 60 acquisitions to become of the world's leading independent supplier of software.

"Cascade Communications Corp's earnings for the third quarter ended September blew past the published analysts' consensus estimate by a solid $0.02 a share, but fell shy of Wall Street expectations nonetheless. Despite year-on-year quarterly earnings growth of roughly 200 percent, investors dumped the stock in after-hours trading on Thursday evening, sending the stock down 6-1/2 to 80, traders said. Cascade reported $0.21 versus $0.07 a year ago. Securities analysts said the disappointment lay in comparing Casade's sequential quarterly earnings growth. ""The issue was that it was trading at 60 times over the 1997 earnings forecast,"" said Hambrecht network equipment analyst Joe Noel, who holds a strong buy on the stock. ""They really needed $0.04 per share on the upside to maintain that price on the upside in my opinion,"" he said. Investors were betting Cascade could once again blow past analysts earnings estimates on the same scale it had done in the second quarter ended in June, the analyst said. In the June quarter, Cascade reported earnings that were 43.5 percent greater than seen in the first quarter of 1996. ""The second quarter had a big revenues spike and the third quarter was expected to be up on a similar basis sequentially,"" Noel said. By contrast, the most recent third quarter showed sequential growth of only 17 percent versus the strong second quarter. Cascade had reported above 20 percent sequential growth in quarterly earnings for every period since June 1995. There was nothing in the report or the conference call that followed which suggested problems in the company's business fundamentals, several analysts stressed. Noel said he expected the sell-off to continue to play out on Friday morning, but for bargain-hunters to then snatch up the stock, as it remains one of the strongest plays in its sector. In a phone interview after a conference call with analysts, Cascade chief executive Daniel Smith said he could point to nothing in the company's third quarter experience that would explain the sell-off in the company's stock. To demonstrate it health, Smith pointed to how the company had derived between 10 and 15 percent of its overall revenues from Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) products, an entirely new line of business introduced only early this year. In addition, Smith said Cascade's strategic alliance with International Business Machines Corp was performing according to plan. ""We are pleased with the progress we are making and our plans are on track with IBM,"" he said. Noel said the principal hazard for an investor in a telecommunmications equipment supplier like Cascade was the lumpiness of earnings from quarter to quarter. He noted that Cascade's small number of telephone company customers thought in terms of year-long buying cycles, causing Cascade shipment volumes to fluctuate from quarter to quarter, and leaving it exposed if even one customer delays a purchase. In its earnings report, Cascade said its revenues for the third quarter increased 162 percent to $94.2 million from $36.0 million recorded for the same period in 1995. Net income for the quarter increased to $20.3 million, or $0.21 per share, compared with net income of $6.8 million, or $0.07 per share, for the same period in 1995. Analysts had expected $0.19 per share in the most recent quarter. -- New York Newsdesk, 212-859-1736 ",EricAuchard
"Coupon clipping is coming to cyberspace. SaveSmart Inc., a start-up company based in Mountain View, Calif., plans to unveil on Monday a credit card-based scheme to allow computer users to browse for and take advantage of bargains offered by a wide range of local, regional and national merchants. Consumers will be able to qualify for automated discounts on groceries, dining out, movies, clothing, furniture and auto repairs, among other items. The company said that using its special credit card eliminates the inconvenience and inefficency of paper-based promotional coupons delivered in newspapers or by direct mail. Industry figures show that only about 2 percent of paper coupons are actually redeemed. SaveSmart said the service dramatically enhances sales promotions by making it easier for consumers to find and use them, while making them cost-effective for merchants to offer. ""We are driving physical traffic into the merchants' stores,"" said Bernard David, SaveSmart's executive vice president of business development. Advertising analysts said the new interactive promotion service could play a key role in transforming the industry, which generates about $120 billion a year, according to the media research firm of Veronis, Suhler and Associates. ""All Web promotions need to be attractive in the real world, not just the virtual world of cyberspace,"" said Mary Doyle, a Web marketing analyst for IDC/Link Resources. What differentiates SaveSmart from thousands of other Internet-based commerce efforts is the linkage the service makes between computer users and actual businesses, she said. The company's Web site -- www.savesmart.com -- offers an online database of merchant promotions personalized to fit the individual's interests. Consumers can browse through promotional offerings and when they find a promotion they want, ""select"" it and reserve it. They can then redeem the promotion by presenting the SaveSmart card at a merchant's store at the time of purchase. SaveSmart targets what it describes as ""neighborhood trading areas"" of roughly 100,000 people. The service will be launched Monday in the area around Palo Alto, Calif., with service expanding to include the entire San Francisco Bay Area by the end of the year. In 1997, the company plans to roll the system out in 10 additional U.S. cities where Internet use is most heavily concentrated, including Boston, New York, Washington D.C./Baltimore and Orange County, just south of Los Angeles. The company said it plans a coordinated direct marketing campaign in each city where the service is introduced to sign up individual card members using mail and newspaper ads. In addition, SaveSmart said it has been successful in promoting the card as an employee benefit offered by large computer companies. ""Our target is to have tens of thousands of SaveSmart members within each neighbourhood trading area,"" David said, adding that he expected to meet that goal in SaveSmart's first service areas ""within a couple of months, to be quite frank."" To date, SaveSmart said it has signed up 400 merchants, representing a cross-section of locally available goods and services. McDonald's, Domino's Pizza and Subway Sandwiches are participating. In addition, it has agreed to a deal with at least one major movie studio, which it declined to name. While the system would appear to be a threat to traditional promotional outlets like direct mail marketers and newspaper publishers, SaveSmart said it is working with one leading U.S. household direct marketer and that there is nothing to preclude it from linking up with news publishers. David said SaveSmart would also make a logical fit with local telephone companies, but declined to say whether the company had reached any such agreements. The company, which has about 30 employees,. was founded by executives from VeriFone Inc. and other Silicon Valley computer firms. VeriFone is a leading global supplier of merchant credit card transaction terminals. SaveSmart provides special VeriFone-built terminals to merchants using its credit-card system. Company officials said SaveSmart is designed to leave open the possibility that the system could be adopted by a major credit card company, so that consumers could use their normal credit card to conduct SaveSmart transactions. The company has held talks with major credit card companies, but there are no deals to announce, officials said. SaveSmart has not disclosed its financial backers. Industry consultants familiar with the company said they include Bill Melton, founder of VeriFone, and also CyberCash Inc., an Internet commerce company. Other backers include members of Germany's Quandt family, who are ranked among the world's richest families, they said. ",EricAuchard
"Intel Corp stock surged ahead in heavy trading on the strength of its third quarter earnings report, but while its success fueled gains in the stocks of PC makers, the Intel report did little to buoy other chipmakers. Still, analysts said Intel's share gains Tuesday remained restrained by uncertainties over whether the third quarter ramp-up might lead to a reduction in fourth quarter orders, a concern magnified by Intel's unwillingness to make forecasts. At midday Tuesday, Intel stock was up 3-3/8 at 111, after trading as high as 114-1/4 near the opening of trading.   Stocks of personal computer manufacturers who rely on Intel micrprocessors also showed significant gains, as investors saw Intel's order surge as confirmation of strong demand for the machines themselves. Compaq Computer Corp was up 1-1/2 to 73-3/8. Dell Computer Corp gained 1-1/4 to 86-1/8. Gateway 2000 Inc swelled two to 55-3/8. ""The Intel report was clearly a positive for the whole PC industry,"" said veteran chip analyst Dan Klesken of Robertson Stephens. ""It is an endorsement of our view that we are in for a strong upgrade cycle for the second half of year,"" he said.   Chips, a PC graphics chip maker, released its own strong earnings report Monday, with income of $0.42 per share in its first quarter ended September 30 versus $0.20 per share in the year ago fiscal first quarter. Other gainers in the segment included Trident Microsystems Inc, which was up 7/8 to 20-1/8, after rising nearly two points earlier Tuesday. Despite these gains, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index of 16 leading chipmakers was down 1.69 points on the day to 197.97. There were only three advancers, including Intel, compared with 12 losers. One was unchanged.   Securities analysts said Intel's latest results demonstrate how fundamentally different it is from other semiconductor makers, operating as it does with a virtual monopoly over microprocessors, the core chips of PCs. Indeed, Intel has benefited from the pain endured by other segments of the seminconductor industry throughout the past year, especially suppliers of memory chips used in PCs. Memory chip prices have fallen by 80 percent in the last year.  A 32-megabit memory now sells for one-third less than an eight-megabit memory did a year ago but has four times the processing power, noted Robertson's Klesken.   Earlier Tuesday, for instance, Texas Instruments Inc, a leading U.S. memory chip maker, reported sharply lower operating income for its third quarter of $44 million versus $289 million a year ago. Correspondingly, the percentage of revenues Texas Instrument derived from Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) computer memory chips in its recent quarter fell to about 25 percent of company revenues from almost 40 percent last year. Intel has cut its own prices by up to 50 or 60 percent on processors since last year.  The combined price cuts have spurred order growth Intel is now seeing, Klesken said.   Robertson's Klesken noted that while the industry revenues are expected to down 10 percent in terms of dollar growth, ""Intel will grow 25 percent in terms of top line, full-year revenues."" Excluding the wounded memory chip makers, which account for roughly 30 percent of the semiconductor industry, the chip industry is due to grow only five percent worldwide this year. ""That says it all,"" Klesken said adding that, ""Intel is so clearly head and shoulders above the rest of the industry.""   Intel, which Monday had reported earnings of $1.48 per share in its September quarter, swept past Wall Street's consensus expectations of $1.25 per share for the quarter. Securities analysts responded Tuesday with a wave of higher earnings estimates for Intel's 1996 and 1997 years. While trading volume in Intel had reached more than 17 million shares by mid-afternoon, gains in the share price were tempered by lingering questions about whether Intel would see its surge in sales carry through the fourth quarter of 1996. Intel did not respond directly to such concerns in a conference call with analysts Monday, citing a proposed law on the California ballot in November that would make executives and directors liable for financial forecasts they made. In addition, some investors appeared to be capturing the recent gains in Intel stock, said Lehman analyst Michael Andrew Gumport, who nontheless reaffirmed his buy rating and set a new 12-month target price of $150 on the stock. ""The stock has done so well that clearly some people are going to take some profits,"" Gumport said.  Intel traded at around 100 only last Thursday.  The stock hovered around 72 in late July. -- Eric Auchard, New York Newsdesk, 212-859-1736 ",EricAuchard

Still, analysts said Intel stock gains were restrained by uncertainties over whether the third quarter's sharp rise in orders may have come at the expense of the fourth quarter. The concern was magnified by Intel's decision to at least temporarily halt the practice of forecasting its business prospects. Intel stock rose $3.50 to $111.125 Tuesday on Nasdaq in a volatile day of trading in which just under 20 million Intel shares changed hands. Intel's gains sparked the technology-heavy Nasdaq index to 1,258.10, up 1.74, its second consecutive record closing high. On Monday Intel reported third-quarter profits of $1.3 billion, up from $931 million in 1995's third quarter. Wall Street had predicted profits of $1.1 billion. Brokers responded to the results with a wave of higher earnings projections for Intel for 1996 and 1997. Personal computer makers who rely on Intel micrprocessors also saw significant gains, as investors viewed Intel's order surge as confirmation of strong demand for the machines themselves. Compaq Computer Corp. gained $2 to close at $74.75 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange, a day ahead of its own earnings report, due Wednesday. Dell Computer Corp. rose $3.50 to $88.375 and Gateway 2000 Inc. climbed $3.375 to $56.75, both on Nasdaq. But Intel's swelling fortunes were seen as having only limited effect on other semiconductor suppliers. Montgomery Securities analyst Clark Westmont said the main beneficiaries were a handful of custom PC chip makers who sell graphics controllers and other PC-related devices. Every Intel processor that goes into a PC is accompanied by serveral such ancillary chips. ""Intel is the locomotive who drags along all the other guys in this food chain,"" Westmont said. ""As a result, these other guys are enjoying higher recognition today."" He pointed in particular to PC graphics component supplier Chips and Technologies Inc. stock, which jumped $4.875 to $19.75, or roughly 25 percent, after it released its own strong quarterly earnings report.

"Computer Associates International Inc said Wednesday it would focus an increasing share of its resources on its midrange software business and reduce its reliance on mainframe software sales. In addition, CA President Sanjay Kurmar said in a phone interview he expected a charge ""in the $500 million range"" related to the planned acquisition of Cheyenne Software Inc. It would be taken its quarter ending in December. Kumar also said the company's international sales growth had ""slowed some"" in the quarter ended in September.   He said the acquisition was likely to be accounted for as an asset purchase with a one-time writedown for research and development costs instead of a ""pooling of interests."" Kumar was confirming comments he and other Computer Associates executives had made in a meeting with Wall Street analysts Wednesday morning. Analysts who attended the meeting said news of the planned revenue transition and slowing in international sales led to a sharp drop in the company's stock. The decline came in spite of the announcement of fiscal second-quarter results that beat Wall Street expectations. ",EricAuchard
"Computer Associates International Inc. issued its quarterly financial results, soundly beating Wall Street's consensus forecast. But the stock fell sharply Wednesday morning after company executives told securities analysts they planned to acclerate investments in its personal computer-based corporate software products and de-emphasise mainframe software sales. Analysts also said some investors were spooked by a slowdown in the company's international sales, which fell about 5 percent in the latest quarter ended in September compared to a year ago. Computer Associates shares lost more than than $4 in early trading but regained some ground later in the day after several analysts reaffirmed ""buy"" ratings on the stock and raised their future earnings projections on the company. The stock closed at $62.875, down $2.75 on the day, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. In a phone interview, Computer Associates President Sanjay Kumar confirmed the company planned to increase its investments in its PC-related mid-range software business. ""In reality, (mid-range software) is the right place to be,"" Kumar said of the company's planned shift in emphasis. ""It is the high-growth business."" The executive said mid-range software amounted to about 31 percent of overall revenue in the latest quarter and was the fastest-growing portion of its business, with sales rising 56 percent above last year's September quarter, he said. ""What we neeed to do is engineer the business to move in that direction,"" Kumar said. But mainframe software continues to account for more than twice the revenues of mid-range products, or 63 percent of the latest quarter's total reveneues of $990 million. Mainframe sales rose 10 percent compared to the year-ago quarter, a rate Kumar said he expected would continue. The remaining 6 percent of revenues derived from its small consumer accounting software and systems integration business. Computer Associates has long been the world's leading supplier of mainframe software, but in recent years has sought to extend this dominance throughout corporate organisations by developing software used to manage personal computers. This shift in focus to the smaller, albeit faster-growing part of its business prompted fears among some investors that Computer Assocites was entering a complicated transition. ""In general, you have to be concerned when a company says that it is going to be de-emphasising a part of its business that amounts to 60 percent of (its) revenues,"" said UBS Securities analyst Joe Farley. But Farley discounted such concerns, saying the company's move came as no surprise to long-time observers of the business software maker. He embraced the choice to accelerate the company's commitment to the newer, higher-growth business. ""Their actions have already indicated that they are moving that way,"" Farley said of Computer Associates' increasing shift to PC-based mid-range products. ""Their words are following their actions,"" he said. Kumar said the company contemplated a ""smooth transition"" over the next two years. Mid-range sales will ""cross the threshold in fiscal 1998 probably"" and become the dominant source of revenue, he said. In the interview, Kumar also said he expected the company to take a charge ""in the $500 million range"" related to a writedown of assets in its planned acquisition of Cheyenne Software Inc. during the current quarter ending in December. The company began a $30.50 per share cash tender offer last Friday for Cheyenne. The company expects the total cost of the Cheyenne acquisition to come to $1.2 billion, which it plans to fund through a combination of cash reserves and existing credit. ",EricAuchard
"Intel Corp stock surged on Tuesday, lifted by a quarterly earnings report that substantially outpaced Wall Street expectations and confirmed its status among analysts as the shooting star of technology stocks. The earnings report released Monday spurred gains in the stocks of personal computer makers who build machines based on Intel microprocessors but it did little to buoy other chip makers.

"Computer Associates International Inc. is expected to unveil Monday a new Internet division that promises to save businesses from the headaches of seeking numerous vendors now needed to set up and manage a Web site. The company, which manages Web sites for large corporate customers, also plans to sign up hundreds of thousands of small businesses to use the service whether they own computers or not, sources close to the company said. In this ""community"" Internet service, neighbourhood businesses such as pizza parlours would contract with Computer Associates to establish an Internet presence, allowing customers to call up a shop's Web site to place an order. Currently, a company wishing to establish itself on the the Internet is confronted with a maze of separate vendors from which they must buy the necessary hardware, software and consultanting services to put together the disparate elements. The aim of Computer Associates' one-stop Internet service would be to shoulder all the messy technical responsibilities for customers, allowing them to focus on their own business. ""Computer Associates wants to ride the electronic commerce wave that is coming down the pike,"" said one source familiar with the CA Internet unit strategy. ""CA will provide a company the capacity for electronic commerce (on Web) sites in return for a revenue-sharing arrangement."" Although not nearly so well known as Microsoft Corp. and other brand name PC software makers, Computer Associates is the world's top mainframe software supplier and the second largest independent software firm overall after Microsoft. Launching the new business unit is one of several major announcements the company is expected to make at its three-day CA World conference that started Sunday in New Orleans. In addition, Islandia, N.Y.-based Computer Associates has slated separate press conferences with Microsoft, Intel Corp. and Tandem Computers Inc. Monday and Tuesday. Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates is scheduled to deliver a keynote speech Tuesday evening that is likely to centre on the further integration of Consumer Associates and Microsoft software strategies. Computer Associates declined to comment on announcements that may be in the works. Specifically, officials would not discuss plans to launch a separate Internet business unit. But sources familiar with Consumer Associates' plans confirmed that the new Internet unit has been formed to help customers create dynamic Web sites tied to internal corporate database systems. A special focus would be to make customer information stored on legacy mainframe systems available via the Web. Web-based electronic commerce tools would tie the system directly to a company's back-office accounting department. The division will account for only a few hundred out of Computer Associates' 9,000 total employees, the sources said. The planned business, which has been in the works since April, would be a natural extension of CA's systems management and database products target its existing customer base of the world's largest corporations, as well as smaller firms. In the pizza parlour example, a customer order would be routed over Computer Associates computers to the local pizza parlour, which would bake the pizza, bill the customer's credit card account and then deliver the order. Customer data storage would be hosted on Consumer Associates mainframes, an unusual feature compared to the hundreds of other Web service providers, who tend to leave information management in the hands of customers once Web site development work is complete. In effect, Computer Associates' plans would resurrect mainframe time-sharing, where in companies rent time on remote computers and pay service providers to assume responsibility for the headaches of managing the systems. Computer Associates stock, which has been trading at historic highs recently, rose $1 to close at $58.25 on the New York Stock Exchange Friday. ",EricAuchard

""CA will provide a company the capacity for electronic commerce sites in return for a revenue-sharing arrangement,"" he said.

A special CA focus would be to make customer information stored on legacy mainframe systems available via the Web.   Web-based electronic commerce tools would tie the system directly to a company's back-office accounting department. A set of basic pricing plans for the services will be disclosed Monday, starting at a minimum of $5,000 to $20,000. Pricing will be kept low by revenue sharing deals in which CA takes a cut of transactions done on the customer's Web site. Morgan Stanley analyst Chuck Philips, who is attending the show, said he expected that the unit's main focus would be to provide Internet infrastructure equipment rather than making an extensive push into the computer consulting business.   Company information would be delivered to a Web browser using CA-OpenIngres database software and CA-Unicenter TNG systems management tools and other Web management software. CA's Internet system also will take advantage of its Jasmine multimedia object-oriented database for combining not just text but voice, graphics and video into an information management system that can be used for electronic commerce. For example, a shoe company's catalog could be published over the Internet with detailed product descriptions and pricing which could be instantly updated as changes occurred.

"Computer Associates International Inc is set to announce a series of deals designed to extend the reach of its systems managment software onto new computer platforms and to strengthen its existing ties to Microsoft Corp's Windows NT, analysts said. They said CA is likely to announce deals that allow its software to run on Novell and Tandem computer systems as well. Computer Associates has scheduled separate press conferences Monday and Tuesday with Microsoft, Intel Corp and Tandem Computers Inc.   CA officals declined to comment on what may be announced. But analysts say the announcements will be made at the company's three-day CA World conference that starts Sunday in New Orleans. Chet Geschickter, an industry analyst Hurwitz Consulting Group based in Newton, Mass., said he expected CA and Microsoft to announce a tighter integration of CA's Unicenter systems management product with Microsoft's BackOffice suite. The two software giants already have a co-marketing pact for CA/Unicenter for Windows NT which was announced in 1995.   ""Where the rubber hits the road with Microsoft is bundling and co-marketing,"" Geschickter said, noting how this relationship distinguishes CA from all but a handful of the thousands of firms developing software to run on Windows. ""This would represent a downward proliferation strategy for CA,"" resulting in far greater use of Computer Assocates software at the desktop level of corporate offices, he said. Morgan Stanley analyst Chuck Philips speculated that CA and Tandem have agreed to a partnership where CA will port its software to Tandem's large-scale transaction computers commonly used in banking and telecommunications.   ""The agreement is likely to be strategic, with little in the way of actual technology or products to annouce intially,"" said Philips, who is attending the CA World conference. It is less evident what the business software firm might be planning with Intel, but one analyst predicted the two would announce a deal for CA to market Intel's LANdesk Novell network management software. Intel, best known as the kingpin of microprocessors, also develops a variety of software, including LANdesk, the second leading set of network managent tools for Novell NetWare systems behind Novell Inc's own ManageWise software.   Microsoft chairman Bill Gates is scheduled to deliver a keynote speech Tuesday evening that is likely to center on the further integration of CA and Microsoft software strategies. Although not nearly so well known as Microsoft and other brand name PC software makers, Computer Associates is the world's top mainframe software supplier and the second largest independent software firm overall after Microsoft. The two have forged a strategic partnership based their respective market strengths. CA's expertise in the complicated software used to manage large-scale computer systems complements Microsoft's dominance of the high-volume corporate desktop software market and helps beef up Microsoft's suite of ""BackOffice"" software products. -- Eric Auchard, New York Newsdesk, 212-859-1736 ",EricAuchard
"Shares of leading U.S. technology companies, already trading near all-time highs, languished on Tuesday as quarterly earnings raised concern that growth would be strong enough to push them to new peaks. Intead, the sector was raked by profit-taking after a strong run-up in stock prices earlier in the fall season. Several analysts and traders expressed concern over the lagging performance of top issues such as Microsoft Corp and International Business Machines Corp, which have taken hits even after healthy earnings reports.   Microsoft was down 2-3/8 at 131-1/2 Tuesday, despite third quarter earnings that beat expectations by a nickel a share. IBM slid 1-1/2 at 128-1/2, the day after it reported quarterly earnings two cents above the Wall Street consensus. Intel Corp was trading 2-5/16 points lower Tuesday at 105-7/16, continuing a retreat from the record level of 114-1/4 it hit after its earnings release last week. ""Some companies are doing better (earnings-wise) and stocks are trading down,"" said one trader. ""Not that there's anything we have seen in the quality of earnings or the outlooks coming from a lot of major companies,"" he said.   But other analysts argued that the lack of follow-through on recent share gains showed appropriate concern over valuations on the stocks, which had enjoyed a healthy rebound after the beating they took in early summer. ""They had a big run and they basically delivered what they are supposed to deliver,"" said James Cramer, president of trading firm Cramer &amp; Co. IBM stock, for example, had been trading at record highs for the year recently. It reached above 135 at one point on Monday, a record intraday level for the past several years.   ""These stocks have come very far in a short amount of time,"" said Phil Orlando, market strategist for Value Line Asset Management of the sector's lagging share prices. ""We have just got earnings out of the way and now we are going to take some profits,"" he said of the market's reaction. Other analysts noted how several once high-flying computer stocks have yielded disappointments this earnings season. Silicon Graphics Inc shares suffered a pounding last week after it reported a net loss. The stock was down 1/4 of a point on Tuesday afternoon at 19-7/8, a new year-low.   Earlier on Tuesday, Digital Equipment Corp reported a loss in its latest quarter of $0.48, well below the estimated loss of $0.14 per share analysts had been expecting. Digital was trading at a new year low of 29-1/8, off 5-1/4. Sun Microsystems Inc was down 2-13/16 at 57-1/2 on Tuesday, continuing a decline seen since it disappointed investors last week by failing to deliver the strong upside earnings surprise now demanded of such high-growth companies. Prior to Sun's report, the stock had reached above 70, or 30 percent above its level in the first week of September.   A few analysts speculated that the lack of follow-through as expressed in share price gains may be tied to a retincence by technology executives to offer guidance on the future and thereby offer fresh reasons to propel these stocks forward. Last week, officials at industry bellwether Intel refused to offer their typical outlook on industry trends, citing fears of shareholder lawsuits that might result if a California ballot proposal were to pass in November. But others heaped scorn on the idea that possible passage of state initiative Proposition 211 was in any way depressing the stocks.   ""Proposition 211 is irrelevant to the market activity we are seeing,"" said John Kinnucan, a technology stock portfolio manage with Strome, Susskind Investment Management LP in Santa Monica, Calif. ""The reason is that people are looking at the quarterly financial results and the share price valuations and they see a mismatch,"" he said. Kinnucan said it was reasonable to question the valuations of even a premier name like Microsoft, shares of which he noted have appreciated more than 1000 since late 1992. ""What would be of concern would be if people weren't asking questions about the valuations of these stocks,"" he said. -- Eric Auchard, New York Newsdesk, 212-859-1736 ",EricAuchard
"MCI Communications Corp. said Monday it reached a 10-year deal with NextWave Telecom Inc. that thrusts MCI into the top tier of U.S. wireless communications providers. Under terms of the deal, MCI said it will connect its network to a system planned by NextWave to provide wireless personal communications services, giving it the capacity to offer service to more than 110 million individuals in 63 areas, including 29 of the top 50 markets. Washington-based MCI said it will buy at least 10 billion minutes of capacity for its personal communications services from NextWave over 10 years. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Personal communications services represent the new generation of celluar communications services, allowing customers to send both voice and data transmissions over wireless telephones. The deal will help underpin the financial future of debt-laden NextWave, which was the largest bidder in the U.S. Federal Communications Commission's auctions for ""C-band"" wireless radio spectrum held in early July. NextWave, based in San Diego and New York, also plans to sell stock to the public. For MCI, the deal enables it to expand quickly into the rapidly growing market for wireless personal communications services. Two years ago, MCI dropped out of the auctions for PCS licences after the bidding became too rich for its taste. But with the NextWave pact and previous smaller deals, MCI has moved to become a major reseller of wireless services. As part of the deal announced Monday, NextWave selected MCI to provide telecommunications and other services supporting the development and ongoing operations of its personal communications services system, MCI said. Among the major markets where Nextwave has licenses are New York, Los Angeles, Washington D.C. and Baltimore, Boston and Denver. ""This agreement with NextWave establishes an immediate nationwide PCS footprint for MCI and represents an important next step in MCI's wireless strategy,"" said Whitey Bluestein, vice president for MCI wireless strategy and development. ""This is the first full interconnection agreement of its kind and brings new competition to the wireless marketplace,"" he said, noting that with full interconnection, MCI does not need to own its own wireless facilities. Industry analysts expect to see some ferocious price-cutting in wireless telephone as competition heats up, and the latest deal will make it even more intense. ""It is going to be a battle of the Goliaths,"" said Bill Bane, a consultant at Mercer Management Consulting. MCI said the NextWave agreement is a model for additional agreements it expects to sign with other wireless providers as part of its wireless interconnected network strategy. The strategy is MCI's blueprint for developing a full range of wireless services and features that will be integrated into its existing communications services. ""This was MCI's strategy all along,"" said Jeffrey Kagan, an Atlanta-based telecommunications industry analyst. He said MCI has historically preferred to resell communications services initially rather than investing in its own infrastructure. Over time, the company selectively builds its own infrastructure as it proves profitable to do so. ""Reselling service was how they became a heavy hitter in long distance in the first place,"" Kagan said. ""What their plan is, is to resell service from other providers and build networks where they see the need to do so,"" he said. Kagan said MCI's deal with NextWave marks the rapid realisation of its reseller strategy. ""This all of a sudden puts MCI on the wireless communications map in a big way."" MCI's plunge into the wireless market makes it a viable competitor to the several existing national players in the wireless business and is bound to heat up the competition in the increasingly crowded market for cellular services. Other national players include AT&amp;T Corp.'s AT&amp;T Wireless unit, Sprint Corp.'s Sprint Spectrum venture with several cable companies, and PCS PrimeCo L.P., a joint venture of AirTouch Communications, Bell Atlantic Corp., NYNEX Corp. and U.S. West Communications Group. Still, Kagan noted that AT&amp;T's wireless unit, the former McCaw Cellular business, remains twice as large as MCI's cellular business, with about 6.5 million subscribers in geographic regions covering 207 million potential customers. MCI's deal with NextWave covers about 110 million potential customers living in a mix of metropolitan and less-densely populated areas.

"AT&amp;T Corp's decision to name outsider John Walter as heir to Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Allen boils down to a basic gamble the company believes it must take to prepare for the torrent of competition ahead. The nation's largest phone company rejected the standard telecoms pedigree shared by most top executives in the industry -- including Allen -- in favor of a more general set of business leadership skills Walter has demonstrated.   Wednesday, AT&amp;T said Walter, until recently the chief executive of commercial printer R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co, would replace Allen as CEO and chairman in 18 months. ""The magnitude of the challenge has got to be at least of the same magnitude as the one that IBM faced,"" said Robert Miles, a top corporate turnaround consultant and author of a forthcoming book of case studies called, ""Corporate Comeback."" But analysts who followed his tenure at Donnelley credited Walter with being a tough-minded visionary who successfully guided the expansion of his commercial publishing firm into a computer-savvy marketing services firm.   ""Walter understands how to run a business and make money,"" said Frank Dzubeck, president of Communcations Network Architects, a Washington, D.C.-based technology consulting firm. At Donnelley, he closed businesses which could not carry their own weight. Earlier this year Donnelley spun off direct mailer Metromail Corp and is planning the spinoff of Donnelley Enterprise Solutions Inc, a provider of information management services to large law firms and investment bank. This crucible of experience will come in handy for Walter at AT&amp;T as the giant company undergoes a similarly wrenching business and technology transition, but on a massive scale.   Walter is certainly not without his critics on Wall Street. Financial analysts must be convinced he can scale his Donnelley lessons upward to address $80 billion-a-year AT&amp;T. Donnelley had 1995 revenues of $6.5 billion. Wednesday, SBC Warburg analyst Barry Sine cut his rating on AT&amp;T to hold from buy, citing disappointment about the naming of Walter to lead the company. ""In our view what was needed was a fresh face with a high-tech resume,"" he said. Donnelley's growth came at a price, other analysts added, noting how despite Walter's visionary style the publisher struggled with falling earnings and restructuring issues.   ""A lot of things have been going wrong,"" said one analyst, citing the lower earnings outlook and falling stock price. The stock price has performed listlessly recently, trading near its 52-week lows. The stock Thursday was at 38-1/8, up 1/4. Still, several analysts classified Walter among the new breed of top technology managers who earn their stripes as sophisticated consumers of technology but who know how to delegate decisions about the nuts and bolts of technology.   Perhaps the most famous example of this type is an executive like Louis Gerstner, who joined IBM Corp in 1993 from consumer products distributor RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp and was with American Express Co prior to that. ""Maybe you don't actually have to have a guy who has time to get his hands dirty,"" Dzubeck said. ""I think the operating issues, the strategic issues become paramount,"" he said, while technology strategy can best be left to second and third-tier managers. Other outsiders who have become the top-guns at successful technology companies include Jim Barksdale of Netscape Communications Corp, the former chief information officer of air freight forwarder Federal Express Corp. Another example would be Alex Mandl, the man Walter has initially been hired to replace as second-in-command at AT&amp;T, following Mandl's departure in August to join a wireless communications venture of Associated Group Inc. Before joining AT&amp;T in 1991, Mandl headed SeaLand Services. ""He's transformed a large, old-line company challenged by new technologies and changing markets into a tough global competitor,"" said Allen in a statement.

However, analysts said that while the NextWave deal should allow MCI to compete with other wireless industry heavyweights like AT&amp;T Corp., and the Sprint Spectrum and PCS PrimeCo joint ventures, MCI's wireless investment remains a cautious one. MCI has opted to function as a major reseller of wireless services instead of paying the hefty price required to buy cellular operating licenses and to build the network infrastructure needed to offer the new services. Under terms of the NextWave deal, MCI will offer wireless services to more than 110 million potential customers in 63 U.S. cities, including 29 of the top 50 metropolitan markets. Washington-based MCI said it will purchase from NextWave over the next 10 years at least 10 billion minutes of capacity to offer wireless personal communications services. MCI also said it will plug the MCI network into NextWave's, enabling MCI to offer wireless services as a seamless part of its overall package of long-distance, local access, Internet and data communications services. ""This agreement with NextWave establishes an immediate nationwide PCS footprint for MCI and represents an important next step in MCI's wireless strategy,"" said Whitey Bluestein, vice president for MCI wireless strategy and development. ""This is the first full interconnection agreement of its kind and brings new competition to the wireless marketplace,"" he said, noting that with full interconnection, MCI does not need to own wireless facilities. Personal Communications Services (PCS) represent a new generation of cellular communications services, allowing customers to send both voice and data transmissions over wireless telephones. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the MCI official said the price per minute would be ""competitive"" with expected rates for wireless phone services over the coming years. As part of the deal announced Monday, NextWave selected MCI to provide telecommunications and other services supporting the development and ongoing operations of its personal communications services system, MCI said. NextWave, which is based in San Diego and New York, was founded only a year ago by Allen Salmasi, a former executive at Qualcomm Inc., developers of the wireless communications technology NextWave plans to use on its proposed network. NextWave is backed by a host of blue-chip venture capital funds and consumer electronics makers who have chipped in a total of $450 million in private financing. The company also is planning an initial public offering of stock. The MCI deal will help underpin the financial future of debt-laden NextWave, which was the largest bidder in the U.S. Federal Communications Commission's auctions for ""C-band"" wireless radio spectrum held earlier this year. NextWave paid $4.7 billion for its 63 city licenses. Among the major markets where Nextwave has won the chance to operate are New York, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Boston and Denver. That bidding process, and additional auctions that coincidentally got under way in Washington Monday, are designed to allow entrepreneurial companies a shot at competing in the emerging markets for wireless communications services. For MCI, the deal enables it to expand quickly into the rapidly growing market for wireless personal communications services after having missed several chances to enter the business in prior years. In early 1995, MCI dropped out of an earlier round of ""big-league"" auctions for PCS licences after the bidding became too rich for its taste. Previously, MCI had flirted with the acquistion of Nextel Communications Inc. as a route into the wireless arena. While impressive sounding, analysts noted that MCI's committment to buy an average of one billion minutes per year over 10 years from NextWave represents a conservative bet on the growth of the wireless phone market. One billion minutes of air-time amounts to a fraction of current cellular phone use, which is estimated to be running at about 40 billion minutes this year, based on industry calculations of roughly 36 million subscribers. MCI said the NextWave agreement is a model for additional agreements it expects to sign with other wireless providers as part of its wireless interconnected network strategy. ""This was MCI's strategy all along,"" said Jeffrey Kagan, an Atlanta-based telecommunications industry analyst. ""Reselling service was how they became a heavy hitter in long distance in the first place,"" Kagan said. ""What their plan is, is to resell service from other providers and build networks where they see the need to do so,"" he said. Industry analysts expect to see ferocious price-cutting among wireless telephone service providers as competition heats up, and the latest deal will make it even more intense. MCI's stock gained $1.25 to close at $26.75 on the Nasdaq. ",EricAuchard
"The picture for personal computer demand in the third quarter of 1996 was either half-empty or half-full, depending on which of two market research firms' data is used. Technology market research firm International Data Corp. said Monday that growth in U.S. PC shipments from a year ago slackened to 12 percent, ""the slowest pace in five years,"" based on its preliminary third-quarter statistics. A second firm, Dataquest, said PC makers ""prospered"" in the third quarter as worldwide shipments rose 16.3 percent from the same period a year ago. The conflicting conclusions reflect IDC's focus on the U.S. market, which accounts for a substantial majority of world PC demand, versus Dataquest's emphasis on overall global shipments. ""We're making mountains out of molehillls,"" Dataquest PC analyst Kimball Brown said of concerns that PC growth may be slowing. ""The point here is that we had a strong PC market all year ... What other market of this size grows at 20 percent?"" Reflecting a more sombre view of the industry's recent performance, IDC analyst Eric Lewis said ""PC vendors are being extra careful this year, after getting burned by excess inventory at the end of 1995."" However, the researchers agreed on which companies ended up as winners and losers in the third period. They said Compaq Computer Corp. once again led in shipments of PCs both worldwide and in the United States. At the same time, Apple Computer Inc. and the combined force of Packard Bell Inc. and NEC Corp. saw declines, compared with very strong year-ago periods. Both research firms agreed that fourth quarter PC shipments are likely to pick up the pace over the third quarter, boosting the totals for the full year. IDC forecast that worldwide personal computer shipments will grow 18.5 percent for 1996 as a whole, while Dataquest projects the global PC market will grow by 19.7 percent. Underlying the dispute over the health of the current market is a comparison with last year's banner year, viewed by analysts as a historic upswing in demand that is unlikely to be repeated anytime soon. IDC reckoned that worldwide PC shipments grew 23.8 percent in 1995, while Dataquest put the figure at 24.7 percent. Dataquest said U.S. PC shipments rose 12.5 percent during the third quarter, or roughly the same level as reported by International Data. IDC said quarterly unit shipments rose 16 percent worldwide, down slightly from what Dataquest reported. PC makers showed greater caution in the latest third quarter, compared with the same period a year ago, IDC said. In the 1995 third quarter, a number of vendors, especially Apple and Packard Bell, had shipped large quantities of PCs to retailers in anticipation of strong holiday sales. That jump led to an over-supply of inventory that hurt the industry late last year and resulted in greater caution this time around. PC vendors now appear to be holding back on shipments while they gauge holiday buyers' demand, IDC said. In the upcoming quarter, IDC's Lewis predicted, ""Shipments will pick up as we move through the fourth quarter, leading to a happy holiday season for the PC industry."" Though he too is optimistic about fourth quarter market growth, Dataquest's Brown cautioned that ""Every year it gets tougher to maintain 20 percent annual growth."" ",EricAuchard
"America Online Inc unveiled a broad strategy to transform the online service provider into a mass media company in a move that further renders Internet access services a commodity business. Earlier Tuesday, the world's leading online service introduced a flat-rate Internet pricing option as a part of a comprehensive restructuring plan, ending years of resistance to competing directly with Internet access providers on price.   In addition, AOL said it hired Robert Pittman, a prominent media executive, to head its flagship online service, and put forth measures aimed at shoring up its image with investors. AOL had said it planned to take $460 million in charges spread over the recently ended September quarter and the upcoming December period, mainly to cover its switch to a more conservative method of accounting for marketing costs. The stock see-sawed as investors digested whether the near-term profits impact was compensated for by the prospect AOL would become a stable, but growing, mass media enterprise. AOL shares had risen 1 to 25-5/8 in late trading Tuesday.   Gary Arlen, an online industry analyst, said ""the market is responding to the financial announcements and not to the promise of all these other plans, including what Pittman brings to the company."" Arlen added that the restructuring plan demonstrates that AOL ""is a dynamic company that can respond to challenges decisively. In an interview, AOL chairman Steve Case said Pittman -- the broadcast executive who created MTV and made it the first profitble cable TV company -- was hired to help lead AOL into a new era of growth by addressing the mass media market.   While Case expects AOL to pass the 10 million mark in subscriptions late in calender year 1997, ""The focus is not on getting to 10 million, but getting out to tens of millions and that's what (Pittman) is focused on,"" he said of the new divsion head. Pittman, who also took part in the phone interview, said that with TV-sized audiences on the horizon, AOL planned to accelerate its emphasis on advertising, online merchandising and sources of revenue other than subscriber fees. ""The main point is that we are really shifting the business model toward these new sources of revenues,"" he said.   Analysts said AOL's thrust into the Internet access business will have reprucussions for rival online companies, Internet access providers and even the firms that create special entertainment and other programming for the Internet. Arlen said the first casualty of AOL's plans to offer seemless access to the Internet will be its own GNN Internet service, which AOL told analysts it plans to discontinue. At a new rate of $19.95, AOL puts itself in the same pricing league as ""pure"" Internet access providers, such as Netcom On-Line Communications Inc and Earthlink Network Inc, which offer little or no proprietary content.   ""What happens is that access becomes a commodity service,"" said Arlen, who heads Arlen Communications Inc in Bethesda, Md. ""AOL has now defined the $20 a month Internet access rate as a commodity,"" he said. However, in a phone interview, David Garrison, Netcom's chief executive said he expects to feel little direct impact from the AOL move, since Netcom is mainly focused on serving and ""adding value"" for business customers. Netcom, with 562,000 paying subscribers as of September 30, is the largest independent provider of Internet access. More than 98 percent of Netcom's customers already pay $19.95.   ""The difference is that our product is not aimed at the consumer, the entertainment sector if you will,"" he said in contrasting AOL's core market with Netcom's business focus. Reflecting the differing demand of his base of small and medium-sized business customers, Garrison claimed that Netcom turnover rates have remained relatively low and stable over the last seven quarters -- in striking contrast to AOL. Arlen noted that America Online also discussed ambitious plans to develop an increasing amount of programming content for the Internet in its newly created AOL Studio division, led by long-time executive Ted Leonsis.   In effect, AOL is commodifying the programming content on the Web, much in the way the big Hollywood movie studios have dominated film and broadcast production, Arlen said. ""AOL is becoming a one-stop source for Internet access, programming content and other services,"" Arlen said. ""I expect that AOL's offerings will be totally satisfactory to the millions of users who are newbies to the Internet and a large number of heavy users who are fed up with shopping for deals."" Abhishek Gami, an analyst at Nesbitt Burns Securities, added that, ""Now there will be less confusion both for investors and for consumers as well."" -- New York newsdesk, 212-859-1736 ",EricAuchard
"Microsoft Corp. and Fore Systems Inc. plan to annouce Tuesday a deal in which Microsoft will license Fore's high-speed networking technology for use in future versions of its Windows operating system software, according to sources familiar with the deal. Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is an emerging technology on which a new generation of higher speed networks are being built that are better able to handle voice, video and data simultaneously. The sources said the deal will integrate Fore's ATM emulation software directly into the Windows operating system, allowing desktop office computers to use ATM technology without changing other existing computer software. As a result, the deal could open up a potential market of millions of PC users to adopt ATM network technology, while ensuring compatability with older network technologies. Neither Microsoft nor Fore Systems would confirm the deal. But industry analysts said Microsoft's backing of ATM should boost the technology's legitimacy with corporate network administrators, who to date have proved reluctant to install higher-cost ATM networks in place of existing ones. ""It will make connecting PCs to ATM networks easier because all you will have to do is buy an ATM switch, buy an adapter card and a PC is up and running,"" said Mary Petrosky, a network analyst with The Burton Group in San Mateo, Calif., referring to the basic equipment necessary to install ATM. Petrosky was one of a handful of analysts who were pre-briefed by the companies about outlines of the deal. Existing technologies such as Ethernet and Token Ring have been around since the 1970s and remain the dominant standards for networks that connect corporate office computers. ATM is considered more expensive because it requires investments in existing network infrastructure like cabling, switches and other equipment to be ripped out and replaced. Sources said integration of ATM into Windows software will help standardize ATM networking products, making it easier to develop ATM products, while driving down customer costs. Microsoft's own software business is likely to benefit from enabling networks able to transmit multimedia-rich information to become more widely available, Petrosky said. To date, ATM backers, including Fore, the recognized industry leader in ATM technology development, have failed to win widespread adoption of it in corporate office networks. Instead, Fore has built a fast-growing business selling ATM technology to telephone carriers who use it to transmit large volumes of data at high speeds over the backbone sections of their wide area telecommunciations networks. Fore also sells adapter cards that can be installed inside personal computers that allow them to accept information transmitted over these wide area networks. Here, it faces growing competition from Cisco Systems Inc, Cascade Communications Corp. and others. Jeremy Duke, a network hardware analyst with the market research firm InStat, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., said Microsoft's intergration of ATM would eliminate some of the hurdles of connecting ATM networks to desktop PCs. However, he expected the deal's main impact would be to lend visibility to Fore's wide area network ATM business, by providing a broader base of PCs ready to communicate over networks using a mix of ATM and non-ATM technology. ""The deal puts ATM on a little bit more of an even-footing,"" Petrosky said, but noted, ""There are still cost issues and competing technology issues."" Petrosky was referring to how ATM has been upstaged in corporate office networks by an intermediate class of technology known as Fast Ethernet, which allows networks using existing hardware to handle some multimedia communications. In addition, she said the network industry was beginning to embrace a new method known as Gigabit Ethernet that could rival ATM capabalities in many repects. Gigabit Ethernet allows video transmission at speeds roughly similar to ATM. ""It's another thing that can help ATM, but I don't think it's going to drastically change the odds for ATM acceptance,"" Duke agreed. ""There are other cost-effective technologies available today,"" he said, referring to Fast Ethernet systems. It was not clear from the sources whether Microsoft's plans extended beyond its Windows NT and Window 95 operating systems to include its older Windows 3.1 system. ",EricAuchard
"Bay Networks Inc shares bounded higher on Wednesday on news the company had named a senior Intel Corp official as chairman and chief executive, a move analysts said could give Bay the strong hand it has lacked. ""It's quite a positive,"" said Bear Stearns networking analyst Eric Blachno of the long-time Intel executive David House's selection. ""It's good to know the company is not going to be rudderless.""   Bay shares gained 1-3/4 to 20-1/8 on Wednesday, rising from their 52-week basement. The shares were among the five most active on the NYSE. Blachno said he will remain on the sidelines before once again backing the stock until he sees what strategies House may have in store to return Bay to prominence within the networking industry. The analyst downgraded the stock to neutral from buy after Bay's last earnings report, which he said included ""ominous"" signs of trouble in the company switching business, which accounts for about 20 percent revenues.   Bay's switch business has shown sequential declines in revenues for the last two quarters, even as rivals Cisco Systems Inc and 3Com Corp have delivered double-digit growth on larger revenue bases, Blachno noted. Despite its reputation as a technology leader in the networking industry, Bay's finanical performance has marked it as a laggard within the group over the last several years. By contrast, Cisco and 3Com have positioned themselves in front of an avalanche of demand for networking products and their shares have reflected that success.   Wall Street analysts have complained that the company has suffered from a crisis of leadership in recent months. Leadership has been an issue for Bay ever since it was formed by the merger of Wellfleet and Synoptics and 1994. Analysts said difficulties encountered in combining the predecessor companies' product lines became magnified by an attempt to operate the companies out of headquarters on two coasts: in Santa Clara, Calif. and Billerica, Mass. The hiring of David House as chairman, president and CEO consolidates in one leader's hands the role of chairman, which had been held by Paul Severino founder of Wellfleet, and former chief executive Andrew Ludwick, a founder of Synoptics. Severino remains a director of the company and is expected to play an important role in defining technology strategy. Ludwick resigned two weeks ago from the company, following several months of speculation that he planned to leave. ""We continue to believe Bay is going to be a long-term player and one of the leading companies in its industry,"" said Blachno, adding that, ""Of course, it will take some time before the new leader maps his course."" -- Eric Auchard, New York newsdesk, 212-859-1736 ",EricAuchard
"Computer distribution powerhouse Ingram Micro Inc. is set to hold its widely anticipated initial public offering on Wall Street Thursday despite some last-minute delays, including management changes. ""We haven't seen anything comparable in the technology sector with its kind of name this year,"" said Manish Shah, editor and publisher of the IPO Maven, of the new issue. Anticipating heavy demand, the estimated price on Ingram's 20 million share offering was boosted to $17 to $19 a share Wednesday from $14 to $16, said underwriter Morgan Stanley.   As the world's leading distributor of computer hardware, software and networking equipment to corporate resellers and computer retailers, Santa Ana, Calif.-based Ingram is a veritable steam-engine of computer industry growth. There are really only three world-class distributors of computer products: Ingram, with revenues expected to hit roughly $10 billion this year, Merisel Inc. with $6 billion and Tech Data Corp. at $4 billion.   That size advantage is crucial said Seymour Merrin, a leading industry analyst, who heads Merrin Information Services Inc. in Palo Alto, Calif. ""Market share isn't just an important factor,"" Merrin said. ""It's the only factor."" Ingram's suppliers read like a Who's Who of the leading computer brands -- names like IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Cisco, Apple, Novell and U.S. Robotics. And like many of those names, Ingram is seen as the undisputed leader in its own industry. Its main customers are not end-users of technology products, but the middlemen of distribution -- corporate resellers, systems intergrators and computer retailers.   ""Ingram's got it all: distribution power, brand quality and customer or franchise loyalty,"" Shah said. Underlying excitement about the new stock is a belief that Ingram is positioned to benefit directly from a multi-year computer buying boom expected to take hold later this year or early in 1997 and last for anywhere from two to four years. Companies are preparing to upgrade to faster Intel Pentium PCs running Microsoft Windows NT and buy a host of related products made passible by the more powerful machines.   In one important respect, however, Ingram should not be classified with other top technology names famous for their explosive earnings growth and spiraling stock prices. Ingram competes in a brutal low-margin business that has more in common with supermarkets or trucking than computers -- its profit margins have in fact declined to 6.8 percent in the first half of 1996 from 8.1 percent in 1993. The company's path to Wall Street has not been without its detours and mishaps.   An anticipated public offering was temporarily derailed earlier in the year when Linwood ""Chip"" Lacy -- the engineer credited with driving Ingram Micro's growth over the years -- resigned as chairman and chief executive. Ingram located a prominent replacement in Jerre Stead, the former head of mainframe software maker Legent Corp. until its 1995 acqusition by Computer Associates International Inc. It named Michael Grainger chief finacial officer two weeks ago. But any Ingram doubters will remain on the sidelines Thursday.   ""It is definitely one of the best offerings of the year. There is great demand,"" said Shah for shares of the stock. ""I think it will remain strong and by the end of year, it could be a $30 stock,"" he added.   In an industry known for its love of jargon, computer business insiders speak with a mix of reverential awe about ""the Channel"" - short for distribution channel and the delivery mechanism that has make-or-break control over the future of any computer product. Ingram is to ""the Channel"" what Microsoft is to software, Intel is to microprocessors and Cisco is to networking. ",EricAuchard

"Battling competition in its core long-distance phone business, a need to enter new markets and a looming management transition, AT&amp;T Corp. faces an even broader challenge in the proposed merger of British Telecommunications Plc and MCI Communications Inc., two of its biggest adversaries. British Telecom announced Sunday it planned to acquire the remaining 80 percent of MCI it does not already own in a complicated cash and stock transaction that values MCI at more than $20 billion. AT&amp;T responded to news of the huge cross-border deal by calling on U.S. and European regulators to condition approval of it on a further freeing of competition in British Telecom's home market in the United Kingdom, even as British Telecom argued that it was already among the world's most open. The merger would bring together the aggressive marketing skills of MCI -- the No. 2 U.S. long distance provider behind AT&amp;T -- with the deep pockets of the former British phone monopoly to form Concert, a combined entity with unprecedented global reach. Analysts said the merger increases British Telecom's and MCI's scope for global pooling of resources and strategy coordination and puts pressure on AT&amp;T to beef-up its international strategies even as it must contend with an array of distractions at home. ""AT&amp;T is the one with the most to lose,"" said Forrester Research industry analyst David Goodtree. ""The company is in danger of becoming just another player,"" he said, noting how rivals large and small have begun to erode AT&amp;T's long-held dominance of the U.S. long-distance business. The former U.S. phone monopoly has seen its share of the country's $75 billion long-distance market slip to under 55 percent from 60 percent two years ago. ""This deal really forces AT&amp;T to respond and unfold its strategy,"" said Berge Ayvazian, senior telecoms analyst with Yankee Group in Boston. With British Telecom's financial backing, MCI is expected to step up its attack on the $90 billion local U.S. phone market, Ayvazian said. MCI already plows nearly $1 billion a year into the fiber optic networks that will allow its MCI Metro unit to supply local phone service in roughly half the United States. AT&amp;T has been groping for a strategy to enter the U.S. market for local telephone services, even as another set of rivals, the regional Bell companies like Bell Atlantic/NYNEX Corp. and SBC/Pacific Telesis Group seek permission to enter the long-distance business. ""AT&amp;T must now find some counterpoint to the BT-MCI strategy by trying to open up and reveal its local plans,"" Ayvazian said. ""The company has become more and more isolated as the Bell companies prepare to enter the long-distance market and as AT&amp;T still relies on a go-it-alone strategy,"" agreed David Roddy, chief telecommunications economist at the Deloitte &amp; Touche Consulting Group. The proposed merger of BT and MCI is just the latest in a succession of threats to AT&amp;T's status as a global telecommunications carrier and its leadership of the U.S. phone business. In September, AT&amp;T shocked Wall Street by warning that its second-half earnings would be dampened by continuing pressures in its long-distance business and efforts to gear up to offer local phone service in most of the 50 states. AT&amp;T also said its near-term earnings were being hurt by investments in new online and wireless services. The decline in its financial results comes on the heels of AT&amp;T's year-long split-up of the company into three separate pieces, a move widely praised as necessary but one which nonetheless appears to have been a major distraction to its management. AT&amp;T recently completed the spin-off of Lucent Technologies Inc., its former telecom equipment arm, and is planning to spin off its NCR computer operation in coming months. The break-up of AT&amp;T  has heightened dependence on its imperiled long-distance phone revenues. Responding to mounting concerns about AT&amp;T Chairman Robert Allen's leadership, the company recently named printing industry executive John Walter as its new president and chief operating officer and Allen's eventual successor after an 18-month transition. Wall Street securities analysts have questioned the choice of Walter, an outsider to the telecommunications industry, while simultaneously criticizing the delay in handing over responsibility to him. Even those who praise Walter's track record as chief executive at R.R. Donnelley -- where he successfully engineered a complex transformation of the old line catalog printer into marketer of digital printing services -- said Walter faces a daunting learning curve at AT&amp;T. BT still controls the lion's share of the British telephone market, with its grip on local service still amounting to 90 percent. But recent deregulation of the local service market has allowed rivals, including AT&amp;T through its AT&amp;T U.K. operation, to begin competing on BT turf. ",EricAuchard
"Iomega Corp. said Thursday it plans to apply its computer storage technology to handheld consumer electronics in a way that could lower the cost of saving and transfering data to such devices. The reusable data storage system, to be known as ""n-hand,"" could be used in digital cameras, computer game devices, cellular phones and handheld personal computers known as digital assistants. In cameras, for example, the technology could function as a removable ""digital film"" that would replace existing chemical photographic film. ""Our n-hand technology ... has the potential to change the way consumers use portable electronic devices,"" said Kim Edwards, president and chief executive of the Roy, Utah-based company, in a statement. ""We are bringing personal computer-like storage to portable devices,"" added George Meyer, Iomega's director of marketing for new business, in a telephone interview. The n-hand disks are expected to be priced at less than $10 for a 20-megabyte disk, and could be available by the second half of 1997. Iomega said the n-hand disks are about half the size of a business card. Several industry analysts said they believe Iomega's technology could help propel digital cameras into the consumer mainstream within a matter of years, by freeing users from the fixed capacity of existing flash memory storage and by substantially reducing the overall cost of such cameras. A digital camera could store from 50 to 80 images on a single $10 n-hand disk, Iomega said, depending on image resolution. Consumers now pay hundreds of dollars for a flash memory card capable of holding the same number of images, it noted. Jim Porter, a data storage analyst with market research firm Disk/Trend Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., said the Iomega technology could cut the cost of storing photographs by a factor of 20 times. A Kodak digital camera costing $499 currently could be priced as low as $300 within a matter of years, he said, reflecting the elimination of more costly digital storage methods. Iomega's plans pose a theat to makers of flash memory chips that are used to store digital information in such small electronic devices currently. Leading makers including Sandisk Corp., Intel Corp. and Toshiba Corp. In addition, the Iomega system could help accelerate the current digital transformation of the camera industry, leading to a decline in revenues that cameramakers receive from conventional silver halide-based photo film and equipment. ""With 'n-hand' you have a digital camera that you can treat like a regular camera,"" Meyer said, referring to the replaceable nature of the Iomega high-density floppy disk system. ""This technology can make digital cameras much more competitive with regular ones,"" he said. Besides lacking a low-cost removable storage medium, digital cameras offer inferior picture quality but image resolution is improving rapidly, analysts said. This could lead to explosive growth of the new cameras in coming years. Shares of the company closed up $1.375 to $25.375 on active trading on Nasdaq. On Friday, Iomega's stock will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange. ",EricAuchard

A digital camera could store from 50 to 80 images on a single $10 n-hand disk, Iomega said, depending on image resolution. Consumers now pay hundreds of dollars for a flash memory card capable of holding the same number of images, it noted. Jim Porter, a data storage analyst with market research firm Disk/Trend Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., said the Iomega technology could cut the cost of storing photographs by a factor of 20 times. A Kodak digital camera now costing $499 could be priced as low as $300 within a matter of years, he said, reflecting the elimination of more costly digital storage methods.   Iomega's plans pose a theat to makers of flash memory chips that are used to store digital information in such small electronic devices currently. Leading makers include Sandisk Corp, Intel Corp and Toshiba Corp. In addition, the Iomega system could help accelerate the current digital transformation of the camera industry, leading to a decline in revenues that cameramakers receive from conventional silver-halide-based photo film and equipment. ""With 'n-hand' you have a digital camera that you can treat like a regular camera,"" Meyer said, referring to the replaceable nature of the Iomega high-density floppy disk system. ""This technology can make digital cameras much more competitive with regular ones,"" he said. Besides lacking a low-cost removable storage medium, digital cameras offer inferior picture quality but image resolution is improving rapidly, analysts said. This could lead to explosive growth of the new cameras in coming years. Shares of the company closed up $1.375 to $25.375 on Thursday in active trading on the Nasdaq. On Friday, Iomega's stock will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange. -- New York Newsdesk, 212-859-1736 ",EricAuchard
"H&amp;R Block Inc., citing problems facing the online service industry, said Wednesday it has decided not to complete the spin-off of the rest of its CompuServe online unit, at least for now. The Kansas City, Mo.-based company, which owns 80 percent of CompuServe after spinning off part of the online service earlier this year, cited CompuServe's recent financial troubles and uncertainties facing the online industry. Industry analysts said the problems reflect the changes rippling through the online industry but were also partly unique to Columbus, Ohio-based Compuserve, which has about 5.2 million subscribers, slightly more than half of them outside of the United States. America Online Inc., the largest with more than 6 million subscribers, No. 2 Compuserve and Prodigy have all been hurt as users have gone directly to the Internet with lower-cost Internet access providers rather than online services. Some analysts have said that the online services, which offer packages of specialised information as well as Internet access, may not survive in the long run, though the eventual shape of the online industry remains far from certain. ""A lot of the people are going to read this as the online market is at a crossroads and pretty shaky,"" said one analyst who follows the industry. H&amp;R Block spun off 20 percent of CompuServe in April and had planned to distribute the rest to its shareholders. But it said Wednesday that it has decided not to present the proposed spin-off of the rest of CompuServe to shareholders at its annual meeting scheduled for Sept. 11. ""The board continues to believe that a separation of CompuServe is in the best interests of H&amp;R Block shareholders and will continue to consider the matter,"" H&amp;R Block interim President Frank Salizzoni said. CompuServe's stock has dropped from a high of $35.50 on its first day of trading to near $10 recently. The stock rose after Wednesday's announcement because new CompuServe shares still owned by H&amp;R Block will not come onto the market. CompuServe added 93.75 cents to $13.25 on Nasdaq, while H&amp;R Block fell $2.125 to $25.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. America Online added 75 cents to $31.625, also on Nasdaq. In July, CompuServe shocked Wall Street with a warning that it expected a loss for its first quarter ended July 31, its first as a publicly traded company. The company blamed the high costs of introducing its new Wow! consumer online service and investing in an overhaul of its network infrastructure, as well as a decline in overall subscriber growth as cancellations outpaced new customers. In response, CompuServe and H&amp;R Block were slapped with a shareholder lawsuit alleging they had misrepresented the online service's prospects in the prospectus for the stock offering. When the company last week reported a first-quarter loss of $29.6 million, or 32 cents a share, it also warned investors that losses would continue for the second quarter ending in October. H&amp;R Block, which is also the nation's largest consumer tax filing service, is likely to wait for the online industry to settle down before completing the spin-off, analysts said. In addition to the losses, H&amp;R Block cited the planned introduction next month of new technology for CompuServe and its new Wow! service. Meanwhile, America Online has had problems of its own, including price cuts to stay competitive with Internet access providers and an embarrassing 19-hour service blackout earlier this month. But analysts said that in contrast to CompuServe, America Online has continued to grow, though at a slower pace. ""The problems CompuServe is having are likely to benefit America Online in the next nine months,"" one analyst said. ",EricAuchard
"Leading data networking stocks settled back for a round of profit-taking Tuesday after the strong price gains of recent weeks, securities analysts said. After opening at a 52-week high of 67, industry flagship Cisco Systems Inc retreated throughout the day and was trading off 1-3/8 to 65-1/8.

"Chips stocks, especially those of PC-related manufacturers, posted across-the-board gains Tuesday after the release of a monthly industry report showing robust demand in the North American semiconductor market. Also showing strength in early trading were stocks of companies that make programmable logic devices, including Altera Corp Lattice Semiconductor Corp and Xilinx Inc.   ""I think most of the upside is still coming from the PC industry,"" said Nimal Vallipuram, a Bear Stearns chip analyst. ""I dont think this is information for an industry turnaround."" The upswing in the industry ratio of chip bookings to orders rose to 1.10 in October from 0.98 in September, while expected to a degree, surprised analysts by its extent. The report was largely a sign of general industry health, as the ratio offers little insight into specific segments. Still, it lifted commodity chipmakers, which had stumbled badly recently, including Motorola Inc, up 1-1/8 to 51-1/8 and Texas Instruments Inc, up 1/2 to 56-1/2.   Microprocessor giant and industry flagship Intel Corp rose 1-1/4 to 125-1/8, while PC graphics suppliers Chips and Technologies Inc swelled 2 to 26-3/8 and Trident Microsystems Inc gained 1-1/4 to 22-1/8. ""The magnitude of the improvement was a surprise, but Wall Street has been expecting an improvement,"" said Mona Eraiba, semiconductor analysts at Gruntal &amp; Co. Among Eraiba's favorites are market niche players such as VLSI Technology Inc, up 1-1/16 Tuesday to 21-1/8, National Semiconductor Corp, which nudged up only 1/8 to 22-5/8 and Lattice, up 5/16 to 40-1/4. She also cited Motorola and Texas Instruments, which she considers to have relative upside potential based on the shellacking their stocks have taken in recent quarters. Vallipuram recommends Intel and Adaptec Inc, which makes PC interconnection devices. He also favors Xilinx and Altera, both up 7/8 to 41-1/4 and 70-3/8, respectively. Reflecting broad sector strength, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index .SOXX of 16 leading chip stocks gained nearly five points in early trading. At 1039 EST/1539 GMT, the index stood at 3.32, up 1.56 percent on the day with 12 stocks posting gains, two losing ground and two unchanged. -- Wall Street bureau, 212-859-1736 ",EricAuchard
"Promising the computer industry equivalent of universal harmony, a U.S.-based start-up formed by a brain trust of Israeli computer scientists Monday unveiled a technology that promises to overcome barriers dividing users of rival software programs. Anysoft Inc. said its set of software technologies allows computer users to manipulate information from any application while retaining all formatting and other properties. The system functions as an underlying layer of operating system software, but independent of any one operating system. An operating system controls the basic functions of a computer. Anysoft officials asserted the system can handle text, numerical data, graphical images, video and other data, including information available only at remote Internet sites. ""This is the beginning of true software interoperability,"" Anysoft Chief Executive Illan Poreh said in a statement. ""For the first time, all applications, including those that have not incorporated the ANY Technologies, will work together."" The private Cambridge, Mass.-based firm is backed by Bank Leumi, Israel's largest bank, and 21 private investors, including several senior executives at modem maker U.S. Robotics Corp.. In an interview, Anysoft founder Poreh said the company's team of software programmers was handpicked from among top professors and graduate students at leading Israeli universities, including Technion, the Israeli Institute of Technology. Industry analysts briefed on the technology hailed it as a decisive breakthrough, based on its potential to liberate computer users from dependence on any single operating system, such as Microsoft Corp.'s Windows. ""This is certainly one of the most significant technologies I've seen in the past five years,"" said veteran industry analyst Tim Bajarin, who heads Creative Strategies, a San Jose, Calif.-based consulting firm. ""What Anysoft has done is taken software interoperability beyond a forced Windows-X86 environment,"" Barjarin said, referring to the ruling combination of Microsoft software and Intel Corp. software and hardware systems. Nonetheless, Anysoft's audacious goal is set against a history of failed industry attempts to create a universally accepted format capable of handling all types of computer data. In recent years, leading computer makers like International Business Machines Corp., Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. have rallied around a common software compabability standard known as CORBA. However, this and similar initiatives have been hamstrung by competitive rivalries among industry players and the belief that programmers must unify around a single standard for creating software. Microsoft's own effort at ushering in a ""Golden Age"" of software compatability has gone by several names, such as Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), and ActiveX, its Internet-based compatability standard. But Microsoft's efforts have met with foot-dragging by companies unwilling to cede the software giant any more standard-setting power than it already has. By contrast, the ANY concept is based on the seemingly simple idea that the only univeral information from different operating systems is what computer users see displayed on a screen. ""The screen is the only standard that everyone is using,"" Poreh maintained. Anysoft has created software extensions that give computer users the perception of compatibility without having to address underlying programming differences that have ensnared previous efforts, he said. Anysoft's go-it-alone strategy depends on seeding its technology widely among software companies, Internet service providers and large corporations developing their own software applications, all of which might include Anysoft's universal data routing features in their own products. Consumers would have to wait until products using the technology become available from these companies. Poreh said he plans to charge companies using Anysoft technology in their products a licensing fee starting at around $20,000 and running up to $400,000, depending on the potential number of users of the product. In addition, Poreh said Anysoft plans to ask for a royalty of 1 percent to 3 percent, or a flat fee, again depending on the potential number of customers. ANY technology is designed to extend software systems such as Windows or Lotus Notes, and existing compatibility programs such as Adobe Systems Inc.'s  Acrobat, Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java or even the Internet, rather than replace them, Anysoft officials said. Anysoft said it has held licensing talks with five of the world's top 10 independent software development companies, including IBM. Poreh said IBM's main interest appeared to be in using ANY technology to recover data from so-called ""legacy"" applications running on older mainframe computers where the underlying software is no longer being actively maintained. ANY technology currently works with software running on Microsoft's Windows operating systems. The technology is in the process of being made compatible with Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh, IBM's OS/2 and the Unix-based X/Windows operating system, company officials said. ",EricAuchard
"Shiva Corp stock rose five points Wednesday amid resurgent speculation that it may be an acquisition target of a major network equipment player.     ""It sure looks like people are speculating that its going to be taking over,"" said Robertson Stephens analyst Paul Johnson, who maintains a long-term attractive on the stock.     Shiva shares have risen nearly 14 percent in the last two days. By early afternoon Wendesday, the stock was trading at 53-3/4, up 5 points on the day.     Shiva declined comment on what it called ""a market rumor.""  ""We have had rumors like this before,"" said Cynthia Deysher, Shiva's chief financial officer. ""Our firm policy on this is not to comment on market rumors,"" she said.     Several analysts said signs of merger speculation were apparent in the stock's recent gains.     Cowen &amp; Co analyst Chris Stix noted that Shiva was mentioned in a trade magazine gossip column published Monday as among potential merger candidates in the network industry.     The article, published in the November 11 issue of Communications Week, spoke of a possible tie-up between rival Ascend Communications Inc and Shiva, among others.     Stix said another factor behind the rebound in recent weeks of Shiva's share price may be the company's comments in public forums that it has a potential major contract win with a major telecom carrier it has declined to name.     The Cowen analyst maintains a strong buy on Shiva.     The stock hit a low of 38 in late September, following a steep three-month decline from its historic high of 87 reached in June, when it was a favorite among momentum investors.     Although enthusiastic about Shiva's business fundamentals, Johnson discounted any recent product announcements as the cause behind the recent share price moves.    ""This doesn't appear to me that its product-related. It's too violent,"" he said. ""It's not valuation-related either.""     Analysts consider Shiva one of two pure plays in the explosively growing market for remote access telecommunications equipment. The other is high-flying Ascend, the dominant player in the market.     Johnson said Shiva might also prove attractive to any of the large data networking companies seeking to gain quick market share in the remote access business.     ""With a company in Shiva's position, I can't think of a company that wouldn't be interested,"" he said.  Johnson said that Shiva, which by his estimates has 13 percent of the remote access market, may prove attractive to any of the major network industry leaders -- Cisco Systems Inc, 3Com Corp or Bay Networks Inc.     He left off Cabletron Systems Inc from the list of potential buyers, noting that Cabletron had acquired Network Express Inc in May to beef up its remote access line.     Shiva has carved out a strategic niche in the market for remote acccess products, which are used by companies, Internet service providers and telecommunications carriers to handle data communications over far-flung wide-area networks.     Shiva is the No. 3 supplier in remote acccess, behind Ascend, which  holds 40 percent of the market, and U.S. Robotics, a more diversified company with a 31 percent share, according to Johonson's estimates.     Stix said Shiva, in partnership with Northern Telecom Ltd, has the lead in a new type of network switching product that allows telephone carriers to address the growing overload of their voice networks by Internet data traffic.     -- Wall Street bureau, 212-859-1736  REUTER ",EricAuchard
"CompuServe Corp investors' fears were allayed Wednesday by parent company H&amp;R Block Inc's move to postpone plans to spin off the remaining 80 percent interest in the ailing online service. Analysts said the looming innundation of the market by the 74.2 million CompuServe shares still held by H&amp;R Block had weighed heavily on prospects for the already troubled issue. ""I'm glad that H&amp;R Block came to their senses,"" said analyst Peter Krasilovsky of Arlen Communications.   The analyst noted CompuServe has enough worries from sliding online membership counts and the failure of its new WOW! consumer service to attract a following. It didn't need added pressure from the pending share distribuion. Other analysts hailed H&amp;R Block's decision to postpone indefintely a shareholder vote on its proposed spin-off, but were concerned about what the move suggests for the future of stocks such as CompuServe and America Online Inc. ""A lot of the people are going to read that the online market is at a crossroads and pretty shaky,"" said one analyst of online providers who does not officially follow CompuServe.   ""A lot of people are going to relate this to the online industy in general,"" he said of how CompuServe's troubles have acted as a weight on America Online's stock price, as well. But analysts said that while competition by Internet access providers may have played a part in slowing the growth of the established online service providers, most of CompuServe's problems remain unique and are not shared by AOL. CompuServe stock rose 1-3/16 to 13-1/2 Wedndesday, but H&amp;R Block fell 1-5/8 to 26-1/4 in active trading. America Online stock gained 3/4 to 31-5/8 by mid-afternoon.   ""The problems are 85 percent CompuServe and 15 percent due to general industry issues,"" said another Wall Street analyst. ""If anything there may be a bit of an industry shake-out here."" The Columbus, Ohio-based online service has weathered difficult months since its debut as a separately traded stock. In April, H&amp;R Block spun off nearly 20 percent to the public, retaining 80 percent or so for eventual distribution to shareholders. Shares of the online service have slid from a first-day high of 35-1/2 to just above 10 recently.   In July, CompuServe surprised Wall Street with a warning that it expected a big loss for its first quarter ended July 31, its first as a publicly traded company. The company attributed the loss to the high costs of introducing its new WOW! consumer online service and investing in an overhaul of its network infrastructure. It also cited a decline in overall subscriber growth as cancellations outpaced new customers.   In response, CompuServe and H&amp;R Block were slapped with a shareholder lawsuit alleging the company had misrepresented the online service company's prospects for subscriber growth and profitability in its initial offering prospectus. When the company actually reported first-quarter earnings August 20, it warned that investors to expect a further loss of $0.10 to $0.15 per share for the second quarter ending in October. It cited product-introduction costs.   Fearing it might be adding fuel to the fire, H&amp;R Block officials opted to delay the final CompuServe share distribution vote set for September 11 until more favorable market conditions develop, Wall Street analysts said. America Online has had to contend with business issues of its own, including a price cut to remain competitive with rival Internet access providers and an embarrassing 19-hour service blackout earlier this month. But analysts said that in contrast to CompuServe's falling subcriber rates, America Online has continued to grow, albeit at a slightly slower pace in the summer months. In contrast to CompuServe, they said America Online is poised to see strong membership growth in the coming quarters, and may in effect be taking customers away from CompuServe. ""The problems CompuServe is having are likely to benefit America Online in the next nine months,"" an analyst said. -- Eric Auchard, New York Newsdesk, 212-859-1736 ",EricAuchard
"Intel Corp shares slid another four points on Friday, continuing a three-day retreat triggered by smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc's statement that its turnaround plan is on track. But analysts and money managers were unruffled by what they said was profit-taking in Intel and a temporary shift among some momentum investors to AMD and away from Intel. Intel stock has lost about six percent of its value since Wednesday, when Advanced Micro said it was sampling its Pentium-like K6 chip, which its expect to ship in early 1997.   Intel closed at 115-7/8, down 4, on volume of 15 million shares, marking it as the most active Nasdaq stock. Intel, a key component in the Nasdaq Composite index, has acted as a drag on the market even as the NYSE has hit new record highs. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 1261.81, off 8.55. Edwin Turney, a Silicon Valley-based technology money manager who runs the Panagea fund, agreed, saying: ""You have a lot of profit-taking and then you have got the momentum players who have had a hell of a run in the last 6 months. ""So now they are looking at the secondary players,"" Turney said, referring specifically to Advanced Micro.   ""AMD has been a catalyst for other people to take profit,"" agreed Merrill Lynch semiconductor analyst Thomas Kurlak. ""There is really nothing specifically to explain (Intel's recent decline). It's just another wiggle in the chart."" Soundview President James Townsend agreed AMD's announcement may have provided an excuse for some investors to temporarily shift out of Intel. ""With a stock that has been this incredibly successful, it may be enough to take some profits off the table,"" Townsend said. He was referring to Intel's impressive 50 point rise to new record levels since mid-summer.   AMD stock has languished in recent years after repeated failures to match Intel's Pentium technology. However, since Wednesday, the stock has gained more than 20 percent. It closed at 25-1/8, up 1/2 point on the day on Friday. Analysts said AMD's new K6 chips are not compatible with Intel latest Pentium Pro chips, but the chip could do a healthy business as a simple Pentium alternative. ""There's clearly room enough for both companies to do well,"" said C.B. Lee, an analyst at Hancock Institutional Partners, who follows both Intel and AMD.   ""Clearly, AMD has had some impact in the minds of some investors,"" Lee said of Intel's declines in recent days, but added: ""In my mind AMD is not a threat."" Analysts expect Intel to produce 20 million Pentium microprocessors in the current quarter, while AMD will build only a tiny fraction of that number -- and less powerful processers at that. Like most chip sector securities analysts, Kurlak maintains a strong buy on Intel and a neutral rating on AMD. Lee said he also remains neutral on AMD, ""but its back in my good graces"" with its plans to introduce the K6 chip. In the last week, Prudential Securities analyst Mark Edelstone was alone among Wall Street analysts in upgrading AMD to a buy from a hold in response to the K6 announcement. -- New York newsdesk, 212-859-1736 ",EricAuchard
"Microcom Inc and Rockwell Semiconductor Systems said Wednesday they plan to beef up their technology partnership to speed development of higher speed 56-kilobit modems for central switch equipment. The 56 kilobit modems would allow computer users to connect to the Internet at speeds nearly double the rate of current 28.8 kilobit modems now available using standard phone lines. The deal builds on a decade-old product development partnership between Microcom and Rockwell. Rockwell Semiconductor is a unit of Rockwell International Corp.   New Microcom central site switch equipment would give the receiving end -- phone carriers, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and corporate central offices -- the capacity to handle incoming calls from computers with 56 kilobit modems. ""It increases the market scope of Rockwell's 56k offering,"" said Prudential analyst Jim Thayer of Rockwell's 56 kilobit modem plans. He maintains a buy rating on Microcom. However, Hambrecht &amp; Quist analyst Rakesh Sood said the Microcom/Rockwell pact was a defensive response to a U.S. Robotics Inc initiative already well under way by the company to offer its own set of 56 kilobit modem products.   In the Rockwell/Microcom pact, Rockwell will contribute its K56Plus modem chipset to the venture, while Microcom will offer its Modemware technology, a software interface that other equipment providers license to build their own modems. To speed 56k development, Rockwell said it is opening an East Coast development center with 15 to 20 Rockwell engineers working alongside Microcom staff. The center will initially be at Microcom's headquarters in Norwood, Massachusetts. Rockwell is based in Seal Beach, Calif.   As part of the partnership, Rockwell and Microcom are working together to drive standards development of a new high speed modem standard that would incorporate Microcom's MNP (Microcom Networking Protocol) standard. Modems based on the Rockwell chip design would not be compatible with those from Robotics until an industry-wide standard for compatability can be hammered out, which no industry player seriously expects before 1998.   In the intervening period, modems based on Rockwell's standard will work only with central office switches from partners such as Microcom, while Robotics modems will work only with equipment offered by backers of its standard. U.S. Robotics has licensed its X2 56 kilobit technology to chipmakers Texas Instruments Inc and Cirrus Logic Inc and to modem supplier Cardinal Technologies Inc CRTK.O. Robotics plans to introduce 56 kilobit modems in January and remote access equipment in February, a spokeswoman said. Rockwell's own 56 kilobit plans have been slower getting off the ground, but the company has said it too plans to introduce new 56k modems in the first quarter of 1997.   Nonetheless, Rockwell's technology has been embraced by Ascend Communications Inc and consumer modem makers Boca Research Inc, Hayes Microcomputer Inc and Zoom Telephonics Inc, who are unhappy doing business with rival U.S. Robotics Inc, the dominant consumer modem supplier. Microcom said it plans to incorporate the Rockwell K56Plus technology into central site modem systems that it sells both directly and indirectly, through partnerships with Cisco Systems Inc, Bay Networks Inc, Digital Equipment Corp and Gandalf Technologies INc.   Microcom officials said they expect Rockwell/Microcom modems to be adopted by many network equipment makers who fear relying on Robotics, which is seen as a competitive threat. Microcom said products based the Rockwell design will be available for test and evaluation early in 1997 and that finished products will ship in central site and remote modem equipment by late in the first quarter of 1997. Thayer argued the schism over standards should buy time for the Rockwell camp and may allow it to gain market share from Robotics due to Rockwell's wider base of support. ""They should have a fairly high share of 56 kilobit market over time,"" Thayer said of the Rockwell/Microcom partnership. However, Sood argues the market for 56 kilobit modems will come largely from home computer users not office workers, who have access to other high-speed communications alternatives. This plays to U.S. Robotics' strength as an equipment supplier to a majority of the top 10 Internet access providers aimed at consumers, like America Online Inc and Netcom On-line Communications Inc, Sood said. -- New York Newsdesk, 212-859-1736 ",EricAuchard
"Acknowledging its failure to attract U.S. consumers, CompuServe Corp said it would disband its family-oriented Wow! online service and plans to defend its business and technical customer base. The world's second-largest online service also said it would accelerate the way it expenses customer marketing costs and that it was taking a $28.6 million charge in the latest quarter for previously incurred subscriber acquisition costs. Instead, it said it would pursue higher margin businesses, including international consumer markets, such as Europe.   ""For CompuServe, this represents a strategic retreat back to its basics,"" said Peter Krasilovsky, a veteran analyst of the online industry at Arlen Communications in Bethesda, Md. ""CompuServe will never contend for the King's mantle among the online service/Internet service providers in North America again,"" he declared. CompuServe stock fell 1-5/8, to 10-1/8, in early trading. H&amp;R Block Inc, which several months ago suspended plans to spin off its remaining 80 percent stake in CompuServe to shareholders, fell 1-1/2, to 26-7/8.   Earlier today, H&amp;R had reported a substantial loss for its quarter ended October 31, citing CompuServe's turmoil, and said it planned to go ahead with a cut in its quarterly dividend payment to $0.20 per share from $0.32 previously. In its own report, CompuServe said it lost $0.63 per share for the second quarter ended in October, after charges for exiting the Wow! business and other accounting changes. This compared to a $0.19 a share profit in the year-ago quarter. Disbanding Wow! resulted in an after-tax charge of $4.9 million, or $0.06 a share, and amortization of prior marketing costs led to the charge of $28.6 million, or $0.31 a share.   ""CompuServe's core users have always appreciated that service most for its independent forums and bulletin boards. They don't have any other place in cyberspace to get those services,"" Krasilovsky said. CompuServe officials stressed that no new layoffs would result from the latest moves. Wow!'s 35 employees have already been absorbed into CompuServe Interactive, they said. The company's total headcount stands at about 3,200 worldwide. In a telephone interview, CompuServe spokesman Steve Conway maintained that while his company was abandoning further mass marketing efforts aimed at U.S. consumers, ""If you are currently a subscriber, you will not notice a change.""   Nontheless, the Columbus, Ohio-based company said it would focus its efforts and investments going forward on business and professional markets, its traditional selling point. Besides defending its core online services customer base, they said CompuServe will focus on other profitable operations like its network systems infrastructure unit, which generates 30 percent of total revenues. In disbanding its Wow! service, the company blamed new market entrants, or Internet service providers, pricing competition and the high costs of consumer marketing. The company announced plans to launch early next year a new ""CompuServe for Business"" serivce, an enhanced version of its core CompuServe Interactive with a new software interface and added content from ""thousands"" of information providers.   Despite a series of missteps in the United States, growth remains robust overseas, where CompuServe's brand is the best recognized name among online and Internet access providers. Conway said CompuServe Interactive's service has nearly doubled in its number of subscribers in Europe during the past 12 months, rising to more than 800,000 from about 450,000. ""It's a growing market for these services, and we outpaced the market,"" he said. About 60 percent of CompuServe's European customers are for business, professional and technical users, while 40 percent fall in the consumer category, Conway said. That's roughly the inverse of North America, where about 55 percent of CompuServe's main service are consumers. The 800,000 customers represent the bulk of CompuServe's international base, which totaled 1.12 million at October 31. The Wow! service had been introduced only seven months ago to much fanfare, but failed to get off the ground. CompuServe Vice President Scott Kaufman, the man in charge of developing the Wow! service, promised at the time Wow! was lauched to carpet bomb consumers with free software disks promoting the new service. ""They'll be falling out of cereal boxes,"" he had vowed at the time. -- New York newsdesk, 212-859-1736 ",EricAuchard
"Semiconductor equipment stocks surged Friday on fresh signs the downturn in the chip industry has hit bottom, and the buying spilled over into some computer chip makers as well. Investors jumped in after the leading maker of equipment used to produce computer chips, Applied Materials Inc., gave support to the growing consensus in the industry that the market for chip-making machinery would turn up in 1997. Applied Materials on Thursday reported lower earnings for the latest quarter but also said that even at the low point in the current technology spending cycle, it expected profit margins to stay higher than in prior downturns. That was enough for investors to rush in, even while the industry's profits have yet to start a meaningful rebound. Semiconductor equipment stocks are often seen by investors as bellwethers for the next wave of technology growth. ""Now we have an indication out of Applied Materials that the bottom is not as deep as some may have worried or suggested,"" said Deutsche Morgan analyst Elliott Rogers, who was one of several analysts to raise Applied to ""buy"" from ""hold"" Friday. Applied Materials stock surged $6.625 to $38.625 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq, where it was the most active issue with more than 21 million shares traded. In addition to Applied Materials, KLA Instruments Corp. rallied $5 to $38.25, Tencor Instruments rose $5.50 to $26.75, and Lam Research Corp. increased $4.625 to $34.125. The four equipment stocks were among Nasdaq's 10 most active, while Intel Corp., the world's biggest chip maker, rose $3.125 to $122. Other chip equipment makers also rose, including PRI Automation Inc., up $6.375 to $42.875, and Novellus Systems Inc., up $8 to $57.875. After the market closed Thursday, Applied Materials said profits fell 53 percent to $73.1 million, or 40 cents a share, for its fourth fiscal quarter, which was about in line with expectations. But Wall Street analysts widely believe a new chapter has begun to unfold for the chip industry, which could lead to a rebound in orders for production equipment. The recovery is expected since sales of personal computers appear to be picking up, which means renewed demand for additional chip-making equipment cannot far behind. PCs soak up about half of all semiconductors produced worldwide. The chip industry over the years has become notorious for its boom-to-bust cycles. Many now argue that the latest year-long slow-down in semiconductor equipment spending has stabilised, leaving the industry poised to begin another of its cyclical upturns early next year. This could come even after chip makers aggressively built plants and added capacity last year, which flooded the market and led to a glut of chip inventory earlier this year. Alex. Brown analyst Byron Walker said that during a conference call Thursday, Applied Materials executives said they saw equipment order rates stabilising. But while Walker upgraded Applied Materials and other stocks in the group, he cautioned the companies might be hurt next year by a continued glut of computer memory chips, the biggest category of semiconductors.

"Investors snatched up semiconductor equipment stocks Friday amid further signs the cyclical downturn in chips has hit bottom, spurring a round of buy ratings to be issued for leading industry names. The buying spree followed comments by sector flagship Applied Materials Inc that even at the low-point in the current cycle, the company expects its profit margins to remain higher than in previous market cycles, analysts said. Applied shares gained 4-3/4 points to 36-3/4 in early trading Friday on extremely heavy volume of 11 million shares.   ""Now we have an indication out of Applied Materials that the bottom is not as deep as some may have worried or suggested,"" said Deutsche Morgan analyst Elliott Rogers, who was one of several to raise Applied to buy from hold Friday. Besides Applied, KLA Instruments Corp rallied 5-7/8 to 39-1/8 while both Tencor Instruments and Lam Research Corp sailed up 4-3/8 points, to 25-5/8 for Tencor and 33-7/8 for Lam, respectively. The four equipment stocks were among Nasdaq's six most active, while microprocessor giant Intel Corp, the most likely benificiary of a recovery, was up 2-1/8 to 121.   Chip equipments were also marquee names among net percentange gainers on Nasdaq, with Novellus Systems Inc and PRI Automation Inc featured. Novellus rose 6-41/64 points to 56-5/8 and PRI gained 4-1/4 to 40-3/4. Alex. Brown analyst Byron Walker said that during a conference call Thursday, Applied Materials executives had spoken of a potential stabilization of equipment order rates. But while Walker joined the rush to upgrade Applied and others in the group to buy from neutral, he cautioned that he considered these stocks near-term ""trading vehicles"" that could be hurt by the continued glut of memory chips in 1997.   Several analysts said the rush to buy semiconductor equipment stocks reflected a positive upturn in chip industry book-to-bill figures released earlier this month, which suggested the rebound in the chip market is expanding beyond PC-related chip sets to include other industrial markets. ""Clearly the IC (integrated circuit) industry, lead by Intel is posting a nice rebound,"" Rogers said. ""More importantly at least for (Applied is that) their margins are more sustainable at the trough than was the case in the prior cycle,"" Rogers said of the 1991-1992 downturn that crunched profits in the typically boom-to-bust industry. He said Applied's operating margins were unlikely to dip under ""the low to mid-teens"" in the current cycle of inventory correction compared with the low-point of the 1991-1992 cycle, when operating margins of eight to nine percent obtained. Several analysts, including PaineWebber's Gunnar Miller and DMG's Rogers, argued that valuations of the group did not reflect the sector's rebounding earnings potential. Rogers said he had bumped up his earnings estimates on Applied's fiscal 1997 year to $1.90 per share from $1.85. He maintained his estimate of $3.40 per share for fiscal 1998. Thursday, after the market close, Applied Materials had released earnings for the fourth quarter ended October 27 of $0.40 per share, excluding a $0.09 per share charge, which analysts described as in line with expectations. ""More to the point, prior to last night I thought I was going to have to cut the number,"" Rogers said of his decision to increase his earnings projection for fiscal 1997. -- E.

"CompuServe Corp., acknowledging its failure to attract U.S. consumers, said Thursday it would disband its family-oriented Wow! online service and focus on its business and technical customers. The world's second-largest online service also said it would accelerate the way it expenses customer marketing costs and that it was taking a $28.6 million charge in the latest quarter for previously incurred subscriber acquisition costs. The company said it would pursue businesses with higher profit margins, including international consumer markets, espcially those in Europe. ""For CompuServe, this represents a strategic retreat back to its basics,"" said Peter Krasilovsky, a veteran analyst of the online industry at Arlen Communications in Bethesda, Md. ""CompuServe will never contend for the king's mantle among the online service/Internet service providers in North America again,"" he said. CompuServe officials stressed no layoffs would result from the latest moves. Wow!'s 35 employees have already been absorbed into CompuServe Interactive, they said. The company's total head count stands at about 3,200 worldwide. The company laid off 150 employees, or 4 percent of its work force, in an earlier cutback announced last summer. CompuServe's moves come on the heels of recent aggressive actions by rival America Online Inc. to stay on top by offering a series of new pricing options, including a flat monthly rate of $19.95, and by shutting down its direct Internet access service. Since CompuServe's parent, H&amp;R Block Inc., sold 20 percent of the online service to the public in April, CompuServe has struggled to keep up with America Online, the largest online service, and with a host of Internet-based competitors. America Online has more than 7 million subscribers. As of Oct. 31, CompuServe said it had 3.3 million direct worldwide subscribers. NiftyServe, its Japanese licensee, had a total of 5.3 million, roughly the same level as in July. In reaction to CompuServe's continuing troubles, H&amp;R Block in August shelved plans to spin off the 80 percent of CompuServe it still owns. Since CompuServe's initial public stock offering in April, its prospects have dimmed, with its stock tumbling from an initial price of $30 a share. The stock fell 94 cents Thursday to $10.69 on Nasdaq. Earlier Thursday, H&amp;R reported a substantial loss for its second quarter ended Oct. 31, citing CompuServe's turmoil. Krasilovsky said CompuServe's plan to go back to basics was ""very realistic,"" but added ""too bad they didn't do it a year-and-a-half ago."" The analyst said he expects the company to reposition itself to provide niche services to business customers who don't want to pay for a high-level premium online service. In a telephone interview, CompuServe spokesman Steve Conway said that while his company was abandoning further mass-marketing efforts aimed at U.S. consumers, ""If you are currently a subscriber, you will not notice a change."" Nontheless, the Columbus, Ohio-based company said it would target its efforts and investments at business and professional users, its traditional strength. Wow! was introduced seven months ago to much fanfare, but failed to get off the ground. Wow! customers numbered 102,000 at latest count, the company said. The company blamed the failure of Wow! on new market entrants, or Internet service providers, pricing competition and the high costs of consumer marketing. The company also said it plans to launch early next year a new ""CompuServe for Business"" service, an enhanced version of its core CompuServe Interactive with a new interface and added content from ""thousands"" of information providers. Despite a series of missteps in the United States, growth remains robust overseas where CompuServe's brand is the best recognised name among online and Internet access providers. In Europe, for example, CompuServe said subscribers to its main CompuServe Interactive online service had nearly doubled to more than 800,000 in the past year. ",EricAuchard
"More than $1 billion in royalty payments to Texas Instruments Inc from Samsung Electric Co Ltd will bolster Texas Instruments's net income, and allow it to focus on more profitable lines of business. But while the deal reassured some Wall Street analysts who were not already counting on the additional earnings from the settlement, others noted the terms appeared to be far less generous than one with Samsung in 1995. The stock, which gained 4-3/8 to 60-7/8 by late Wednesday, was among the most actively traded stock on the NYSE.   Earlier, Texas Instruments said it expected Samsung to pay it more than $1 billion as part of a 10-year technology cross-licensing pact. In exchange, each side agreed to drop pending patent infringement lawsuits against each other. ""Our assessment is that the agreement is at roughly 40 to 50 percent of the rate of the old agreement,"" Merrill Lynch analyst Tom Kurlak said, referring to the royalty formula for Samsung to pay Texas Instruments. ""Texas Instruments appears willing to take a lower number to get the suits dropped against them,"" Kurlak said. The analyst maintained an attractive rating on the stock. ",EricAuchard
"Texas Instruments Inc. said Tuesday it set a licensing pact with Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. of Korea that will generate royalty payments of more than $1 billion over 10 years. In exchange, each side agreed to drop pending patent infringement lawsuits against each other. The agreement replaces a previous five-year deal that expired at the end of 1995, the Dallas-based maker of computer chips, notebook computers and other electronics products said. While the deal reassured some Wall Street analysts who were not already counting on additional earnings from the settlement, others noted the terms appeared to be far less generous than one with Samsung in 1995. ""Texas Instruments appears willing to take a lower number to get the suits dropped against them,"" Merrill Lynch analyst Thomas Kurlak said. ""Our assessment is that the agreement is at roughly 40 to 50 percent of the rate of the old agreement,"" Kurlak said of the royalty formula Samsung will use to pay Texas Instruments. The new license, which runs until the end of 2005, covers a broad base of patents from both companies, including those for semiconductors, personal computers, consumer products and telecommunications equipment, Texas Instruments said. ""We are pleased with this agreement and the value it places on our patented technology,"" said Richard Agnich, a senior vice president and general counsel at Dallas-based Texas Instruments. The company in 1985 started to more aggressively defend alleged unauthorised use of its technology in a bid to improve the value of its intellectual property within the semiconductor industry. In the intervening decade, the company has won billions of dollars in additional royalties, a spokesman said. Texas Instruments said it expected Samsung to pay it about $105 million in the fourth quarter for ""catch-up royalties"" covering the first nine months of 1996 when the companies were battling in court. Analysts said the ""catch up"" payments should substantially boost earnings for the quarter ending in December, but the gain will be offset by a charge for an undisclosed amount the company plans to take for an early retirmement programme. Kurlak estimated Texas Instruments will see $35 million in additional quarterly royalties going forward as a result of the Samsung deal, but that is down from the roughly $85 million it received quarterly from Samsung at the end of 1995. With this deal, Texas Instruments said it has almost completed its 1995 round of patent cross-license agreements with major semiconductor makers. Earlier in the year, Texas Instruments reached 10-year deals with Fujitsu Ltd., Oki Electric Industry Co. Ltd. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. It said talks continue with NEC Corp. and several smaller producers. The royalty payments will bolster Texas Instruments's net income, and allow it to focus on more profitable lines of business, analysts said. Texas Instrument stock jumped $4.375 to $60.875 on the New York Stock Exchange. ",EricAuchard
"Small capitalization technology stocks shrugged off a wave of profit-taking that socked blue chip stocks Monday as investors shopped for values among beaten- down or lesser known names, especially in the Internet sector. ""Some of the second- and third-tier technology names have become the focus,"" agreed Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd.   Among the beneficiaries of this broadening interest in technology stocks were America Online Inc, up 4-1/8 to 39-1/2 and Adobe Systems Inc, up 2-1/4 to 41-3/4. Informix Corp was the most actively traded issue on the Nasdaq, gaining 1-1/4 to 25 by mid-afternoon Monday, following reports that its next-generation Universal Server database has the edge over rival Oracle Corp. Other strong gainers included Netscape Communications Corp, which rose 2-1/8 to 58 and electronic payment company CyberCash Inc, which gained 2-7/8 to 28-1/8.   ""We are stepping down the liquidity and quality ladder,"" said Paul Rabbit, Oppenheimer's chief portfolio strategist. ""(Investors) are trying to find some of the beat up ones,"" he said, adding, ""There is a search for less exploited areas."" ""Today is the first (trading) day of a new month and there appears to be a little profit taking here, but it doesn't appear to be affecting the technology stocks,"" Bleier said. Analysts said investors were shying from bellwethers Intel Corp and Microsoft Corp following their strong run-up in November, even as International Business Machines Corp hit a new year-high.   Intel was down 1-1/8 to 125-3/4 on volume of nearly five million shares, while Microsoft shed 1-1/4 to 155-5/8. Both stocks remain near historic price levels.

"America Online Inc's new flat rate pricing plan and moves to meet spiraling subscriber demand suggest AOL is securely on course for becoming a major media player comparable to broadcast or cable TV networks. But analysts caution that underlying this success looms a real threat that the online network's capacity to serve its more than seven million subscribers could soon be overwhelmed. They warn that the additional demand on AOL's network generated by the company's offer of unlimited usage for $19.95 per month imperil its near-term capacity to handle demand.   If only a small fraction of AOL's millions of members were to take up the company's offer of unlimited access and remain connected to the service for long periods of the day, the service would quickly grind to a halt, detractors say. Clearly, investors are betting the company can surmount such challenges, as AOL has done repeatedly in mushrooming sevenfold from under one million users three years ago. In recent weeks, the stock's momentum has revived, doubling from a year-low of 22 to reach 44 earlier Tuesday. An afternoon sell-off caused the stock to fall back to 37-1/2.   ""The market appears to have taken a very bullish view of the new pricing scheme,"" said Arthur Newman, an analyst with brokerage firm Gerard Klauer of the stock's recent run-up. ""But you have to balance this with the realization that the more time users spend online, the higher the cost of adding capacity"" requiring new equipment investments, he said. ""All of a sudden its free candy at the candy store,"" Newman said of the paradoxical downside of a sudden explosion in demand. Although a long-time follower of AOL, the analyst currently maintains no stock recommendation on the stock.   To be fair, AOL officials have warned repeatedly that they expect the next two quarters to be transitional, both operationally and financially, as the company shifts to a new business model that derives revenues from advertising and commercial transactions instead of mainly subscriber fees. But Abishek Gami, an analyst with Nesbitt Burns Securities, believes AOL has proven its capacity to weather the pressures of the explosively growing online medium. In particular, AOL has measures in place to limit excessive connection times by users who now have little incentive to disconnect and free up pressure network time for others.   ""Will this demand on its network be enough to destroy the company? I think not. What the company will do is build-out to meet demand and stage a comeback,"" said Gami, who maintains a strong buy rating on AOL stock. Gary Arlen, a veteran online industry analyst at Arlen Communications Inc in Bethesda, Md, agreed. ""Anyone who is writing this company's obituary is going to be disappointed,"" he said. Monday, AOL said it was undertaking a major expansion of its online network and planned to spend $250 million by next June to double its network capacity and improve service.   Gami estimated the company has about 200,000 modems now available to handle incoming customer calls for its online service and that this number will rise to about 400,000 by next June, the end of its fiscal year. In its Monday announcement, the world's largest online service provider said it was upgrading its network to meet the surge in demand generated by its new pricing and recent marketing initiatives. As of Sunday, AOL began offering the new flat-rate pricing plan, one of several pricing options available to customers.   An America Online spokesman said that, despite heavy usage over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, there were no serious problems with its online network. The Dulles, Va.-based company said that, since July 1, it has added tens of thousands of new modems to AOLnet, which it said was the world's largest dial-in network. The expansion is to accelerate through the spring with tens of thousands of new modems being installed monthly. Analysts said that, with more new users expected, AOL needs to upgrade its network, especially after its nearly 19 hour outage on August 7, which happened during regular maintenance caused by a software glitch and angered many users. Already this quarter, AOL's subscriber growth is on the rebound and, in October, the company added 275,000 new members. In the summer, AOL was hurt by a seasonal slowdown in subscriber growth, a phenomenon common to all online services. Still, in its latest quarterly SEC filing, AOL said profit margins will be hurt in the near-term and it is only likely to break into profitability again in the June 1997 quarter. ",EricAuchard

"Flextronics International Inc Chief Executive Michael Marks said he expects revenues of around $1 billion during fiscal 1998, more than double the $500 million expected in the fiscal 1997 year ending in March. Marks was responding to the nose-dive in Flextronics stock price Wednesday morning that send the stock down 12-1/4 to 25. The sharp decline came after the company announced a restructuring plan that is likely to dampen near-term profits. ""We are going to more than double our revenues next year... to somewhere around $1 billion,"" Marks said.   ""There is nothing but good news here,"" Marks told Reuters by phone from San Jose, Calif.. He was referring to the company's business prospects going forward. He said Flextronics' restructuring was designed to allow it to continue to gain market share and position for it for annual earnings growth of 35-40 percent through the year 2000. ""Next year we will be third in the market by revenues,"" Marks said, rising from its current fourth place position. Only SCI Systems Inc and Solectron Corp remain larger, he said. ""We are on fire as a company,"" he added.   The executive blamed the volatility of the Nasdaq market and the departure of momentum players who had invested in his company recently for the tumble in Flextronic stock price. In particular, he said the sell-off was sparked Wednesday when sellers dumped a relatively small volume of about 80,000 shares, creating the downward spiral in the stock price. ""It's one of the reasons why everyone thinks about getting out of Nasdaq,"" Marks said.   Asked if he considered the stock a buy at current levels, he declined to comment. In a statement released earlier, Flextronics said its restructuring would include charges of $5 to $7 million spread over the December and March quarters, to ""prepare for accelerated growth over the next several years."" The company also said it had told analysts in a briefing Tuesday of new contract wins with Ascend Communications Inc, Harris Corp's Communications unit and Philips Electronics NV. With Ascend in particular, he said the company would be manufacturing the company's mainstream MAX TNT remote access network equipment.

"General Electric Co Chairman John Welch was upbeat about GE's prospects for the current year and beyond during a private meeting with Wall Street analysts, several of those who attended said on Tuesday. In particular, Welch told analysts he was comfortable with current Wall Street estimates for the 1996 calendar year. The First Call consensus is $4.40 per share for the year. Salomon Brothers analyst Russell Leavit said the GE executive had said on Monday he ""expected earnings to be up about 13 percent this year, in line with expectations.""   Analysts said the meeting with analysts helped propel General Electric stock on to the NYSE most actives list on Tuesday. The stock was up 1-1/8 in early afternoon trading after gaining more than two points earlier in the day. A GE spokesman declined to comment on Welch's remarks to analysts. He said the company had gone on record in its third-quarter earnings report, released October 10, as being on track for a ""record year"" in 1996 in terms of earnings. After the meeting, CS First Boston said analyst Martin Sankey reiterated his strong buy on GE and boosted his 1997 earnings estimate by a nickel to $5.00 per share.   ""They are looking for good progress next year,"" Leavitt said of Monday's meeting, one of the company's regular briefings with Wall Street analysts. While litle new was disclosed at the meeting, ""there seems to be a high level of conviction that progress is in place,"" the analyst said. GE's leader specifically cited the company's aircraft engine and power businesses as being well-positioned for growth in the coming year, along with its NBC broadcast unit, Leavitt said. Leavitt retained his buy rating after the meeting and left his current estimates intact. He said he expected GE to report earnings of $4.40 for 1996 and $4.95 per share for 1997, which is a penny above the First Call consensus.

"The stock of General Electric Co. rose in active trading Tuesday, boosted by speculation it might raise its dividend and increase its share buyback programme following upbeat comments by Chairman John Welch. Salomon Brothers analyst Russell Leavitt said Welch told analysts who attended a private meeting with him on Monday that he ""expected earnings to be up about 13 percent this year, in line with expectations."" According to First Call, which monitors Wall Street analysts' earnings projections, GE's profits for the 1996 calendar year are expected to equal $4.40 per share. In 1995, GE earned profits of $3.90 per share, or $6.6 billion, on revenues of $43 billion. Analysts said news from the meeting helped propel General Electric's stock onto the NYSE most actives list. The stock was up $2.25 to $97.50 in late afternoon trading after earlier climbing as much as $3.25. A GE spokesman declined to comment on Welch's remarks to analysts. He said the company had gone on record in its third-quarter earnings report, released Oct. 10, as being on track for a ""record year"" in 1996. The spokesman confirmed, however, that GE's board would meet on Friday. After the meeting, CS First Boston said analyst Martin Sankey reiterated his strong buy recommendation on GE's stock and boosted his 1997 earnings estimate 5 cents to $5 per share. ""They are looking for good progress next year,"" Leavitt said, adding that while little new was disclosed at the twice-yearly briefing, ""There seems to be a high level of conviction that progress is in place."" Welch specifically cited a turnaround in the company's power businesses and strong growth in its NBC broadcasting unit, Leavitt said. ""You've got everything pretty much clicking in the company,"" said NatWest Securites analyst Nicholas Heyman, who also attended the meeting. He said Welch spoke of 13 percent earnings growth for both the current year and for 1997. More good news could come as early as Friday, when GE's board of directors is scheduled to meet. At that meeting, several analysts said they believed the board will authorise a two-for-one split of GE shares and increase its authorisation to buy back the company's shares to $13 billion from its current level of $9 billion. Company share buybacks increase the value of remaining shares by decreasing the number of shares outstanding, a move looked on with favour by investors, since the underlying value of each share held increases. In addition, NatWest's Heyman said he expected the board to boost the stock's annual dividend by 13 percent to $2.08 from its current level of $1.84 per share.

""IBM and Intel, I think have sold here over last couple of weeks, and whatever had to be done has been done,"" he said, which laid the groundwork for institutional buyers to add to their holdings. ""All (these) stocks are in a year-end window-dressing rally,"" said Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management, who concurred that several of these stocks had been oversold in recent weeks. ""IBM is the one all the money managers want in their portfolios,"" Orlando said, referring to the desire to put the best face on their end-of-year report cards by which investors judge a fund's relative performance.

"Apple Computer Inc shares crumbled 17 percent on Monday as hope faded on Wall Street for a short-term turnaround in the computer maker's fortunes and further darkened the company's long-term outlook. Several brokerages urged investors to dump the stock, with Wall Street analysts turning gloomy about the ability of Apple management to put the company's business strategies in order. Apple fell four points to 17-3/4, and was the most actively traded Nasdaq issue with more than 10 million traded.   The company said Friday it expected an operating loss of $100 to $150 million in the first quarter, ended December 27. Apple blamed weak U.S. demand for its Performa consumer PC line and continued shortages of PowerBook notebook computers. The company said these factors contributed to a 10 percent decline in December quarter revenues, versus the September quarter, when Apple reported $2.3 billion in revenues. ""You can't dismiss this as a one-time issue,"" Montgomery analyst Kurt King said. ""It really does say something about Apple's long-term position in the consumer market."" King said he maintained his hold rating on the stock.   Beyond the earnings disappointment, analysts expressed concern over the impending onslaught of rival machines that will be based on new multimedia chip technology from Intel Corp and will run Microsoft Corp Windows software. The latest financial disappointment is likely to deepen Apple's image problems among PC buyers, where widespread doubts have lingered about the company's ability to compete with rival PCs that run Windows software.   In recent years, the distinctions separating Apple's easy-to-use Macintosh operating system from the more complex Microsoft Windows system have narrowed. The changes have led many consumers to abandon Apple for lower cost Intel-based machines that offer a greater variety of software programs. There is also confusion over Apple's future operating system and whether it can introduce a new, distinctive system, based on the NeXT system, which it acquired last month. Apple's latest earnings disappointment arrived just ahead of the company's annual in-gathering of Macintosh loyalists at the MacWorld trade show in San Francisco, which begins Monday.   In a speech slated for Tuesday, Apple Chairman Gil Amelio was expected to chart the company's future course. But Prudential's Young doubted whether Amelio could say anything to reignite enthusiasm for the stock. Young said the speech simply comes too soon after Apple's acquisition of NeXT for Amelio to provide much concrete guidance on the company's future strategy. ""The problem is that he now has to start talking about futures, but he doesn't know enough now to be making this speech,"" he said. ""(Amelio) is not going to be able to say a whole lot about the technical plan, or what they are going to do to bring the new operating system to market,"" Young said. -- Wall Street bureau, 212-859-1736.

"Shiva Corp. stock lost almost half its value Wednesday after the data communications equipment maker stunned Wall Street by revealing that fourth-quarter earnings were likely to be no more than a third of expectations. The company's stock plunged $15.625, or 45 percent, to $19.25 on Nasdaq after it said late on Tuesday it expected earnings for the fourth quarter of 1996 to be between 5 cents and 7 cents a share. That would be sharply below consensus estimates of 21 cents a share, according to First Call, which tracks analysts' estimates. Twenty-four million shares exchanged hands, making it the day's most actively traded issue. Securities analysts said the earnings shortfall triggered the massive sell-off, but that the decline was accelerated by plans by company officials to make changes in Shiva's business strategy that analysts said could imperil earnings further. ""I think the drop was to a large extent a reaction in the stock to the warning of lower earnings,"" said Smith Barney analyst Therese Murphy. ""But I think when people sit back they are also going to be concerned about the change in strategy."" In a brief statement released after the markets closed on Tuesday, the Bedford, Mass.-based company said the shortfall was based on preliminary calculations. Chief Financial Officer Cynthia Deysher said in a phone interview on Tuesday that the shortfall was mainly due to weakness in domestic sales and a decision by International Business Machines Corp. to delay an order during the quarter. ""We didn't receive the Q4 (order) from IBM,"" Deysher said. IBM is a key reseller of Shiva's networking products. She also said the company did not ship as much product as it expected in the quarter. The Shiva official said the company would take steps to address the shortfall, including reorganizing its sales force. Deysher said Shiva had renegotiated terms of its strategic alliance with Canada's Northern Telecom Ltd., a move she said is likely to cause revenues to decline but profit margins to rise, ensuring it can still meet its earnings goals. Deysher said NorTel will assume the costs of manufacturing products resulting from the alliance and cover a larger share of the partnership's research and development costs. Shiva's switching equipment is one piece of a larger Northern Telecom communications system that allows remote callers such as telecommuters or traveling sales staff to dial into central office computers. ""We felt it would be more profitable because we are moving to a royalty arrangement"" with Nortel, Deysher said. Shiva will be paid a percentage of sales instead of for each product it builds, as called for under the prior terms of the alliance. Before its fall from grace, many Wall Street analysts classified Shiva as one of the fast-growing companies best-positioned to participate in the massive demand for network equipment used to build the Internet's infrastructure. While executives said they remained confident Shiva could make up the lost ground in future quarters and still meet the Wall Street consensus expectation of $1.06 per share for fiscal 1998, Wall Street analysts refused to buy the argument. Analysts slashed earnings estimates well below company forecasts and those who had not previously done so downgraded their ratings on the stock. Most advised investors to dispose of shares and remain on the sidelines until Shiva shows concrete evidence it can meet earnings targets again. According to First Call, of nine Wall Street analysts who follow the company, seven cut earnings forecasts and or stock ratings on Shiva. In spite of Shiva's optimism long-term, the new earnings consensus for the year ending January 1998 of the seven analysts was $0.83 per share, down from $1.07 previously. Murphy said that even if Shiva's plans to focus on its newer switching equipment products succeed, it faces stiff competition from larger rivals like Ascend Communications Inc., Cascade Communications Corp. and U.S. Robotics Inc. ""I didn't encourage people to bottom-fish on this correction,"" she said, referring to her recommendation to brokerage clients. ""When you miss numbers as significantly as they did, it draws a lot of different questions,"" said Matt Barzowskas, an analyst for First Albany. ""You get a lot more conservative."" ""After a quarter like this you have to just step back and evaluate,"" Barzowskas said. ""I am not ready to believe they can do what they think they can do at the moment."" But while he slashed his earnings estimates for the foreseeable future, the First Albany analyst maintained his buy rating on the stock at its now severely reduced price. Shiva said it expected revenue for the three months ending Dec. 28 to be $48 million to $50 million, compared with $57.1 million for the prior quarter, which ended in September. The company reported $35.6 million in revenues for the fourth quarter of 1995. Shiva said it will report final results for the fourth quarter and year on Jan. 23 after the close of the market.
