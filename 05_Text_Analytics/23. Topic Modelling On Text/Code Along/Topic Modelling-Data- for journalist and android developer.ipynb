    "\n",
    "A company has a requirement for two job roles i.e Android Developer and Journalist. And your manager wants you to do some basic analysis for him.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most job openings, a particular skill set is desired to perform specific tasks. Tailoring your resume is about recognizing those skills and responsibilities on the job description and making it obvious that you’re up to the task. Your company's goal is to draw the shortest line possible between your experience and what’s stated in the job description.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tailoring your resume connects the dots for recruiters and hiring managers who are overwhelmed by a flood of generic applicants. Instead of proving that you’re an experienced professional in general, it shows them that you’re a perfect fit for this specific job.\n",

    "### About the dataset\n",
    "When performing data science tasks, it’s common to use data found on the internet. You’ll usually be able to access this data in CSV format, or via an Application Programming Interface (API). However, there are times when the data you want can only be accessed as part of a web page. In cases like this, you’ll want to use a technique called web scraping to get the data from the web page into a format you can work within your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to perform Topic Modelling on the given data and extract useful topics that will help your manager to short list the candidates based on the topics for a specified job role.\n",
