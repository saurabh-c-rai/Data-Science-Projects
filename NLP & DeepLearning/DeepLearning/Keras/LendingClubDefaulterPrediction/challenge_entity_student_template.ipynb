    "### Problem statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we are working on the `Lending club` dataset. Lending Club is a peer to peer lending company based in the United States, in which investors provide funds for potential borrowers and investors earn a profit depending on the risk they take (the borrowers credit score). \n",
    "\n",
    "From the given set of data we want to predict `loan_status` of the borrower. We have to predict the loan staus based on the features like `Loan amount`,`payment plan`,`grade`,`verification status`,`recoveries` etc. The loan status having the various categories like `Fully paid`,`charged off`,`late`,`Issued`,`In a grace period` etc. \n",
